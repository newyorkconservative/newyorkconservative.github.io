	</p><p>Islamic extremist groups continue to pile up shocking body counts, slaughtering scores of civilians during the Muslim holiday month of Ramadan. Across Africa, Al-Shabaab (A-Sh) and Boko Haram (BH) have devastated communities in Nigeria and Kenya, ramping up attacks against Christians and all <em>"unbelievers"</em> of their brand of Islam during the holiday.
</p><p>The month of Ramadan, which lasts from June 17<sup>th</sup> to July 17<sup>th</sup>, is considered holy on the Islamic calendar and marks a number of significant religious events for Muslims. While for millions of Muslims this encourages increased piety, giving, and fasting, which take on added significance, for extremist groups, acts of jihad during the month of Ramadan carry greater importance. Extremist leaders opened the month with calls for violence and many of their followers have obeyed.
