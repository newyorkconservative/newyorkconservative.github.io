Allen wrote in his 1967 tract “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=0x1eAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=%22white-skin+privilege%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_sF5Ak82ui&amp;sig=ACfU3U3Z7KdPudpl0sA_Htd2OD-I_rCULg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiSk8nA5LvqAhV_hXIEHT4uBWA4MhDoATAIegQIChAB#v=onepage&amp;q=whitespot&amp;f=false">Can the White Workers Radicals Be Radicalized</a>”:<br><br>"It signifies that the road to power begins with drawing from these few courageous examples two general rules of attack: First, face the problem of the necessity to repudiate the white-skin privilege. Second, act; repudiate the privilege by violating the white “gentleman’s agreement” as completely as you can at every opportunity. Once radicals adopt such an approach to radicalizing the white masses, the implications for particular areas of activity will not be hard to find. If in doubt at first, just make a list of the privileges and start violating them. Whether the white workers can today or in the future be radicalized in a historically more important and lasting sense than in past crises of our history, depends mainly upon the function of the white radicals."<br><br>Allen’s partner in this effort and another leading theorist on “White skin privilege” was another former Communist party member Noel Ignatiev, aka Noel Ignatin. Together their work played a key role in SDS split, with the Revolutionary Youth Movement faction arising triumphant.<br><br></figcaption></figure>
