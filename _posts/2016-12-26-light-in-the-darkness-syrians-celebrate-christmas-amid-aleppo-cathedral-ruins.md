“The festive atmosphere is great. It’s a new birth for Jesus Christ and a new birth for the city of Aleppo,” George Bakhash, a Christian community leader, told Reuters.

He said the number of people attending Mass across the city had surged now that worshipers no longer feared missiles from rebel-held areas.

Many Syrian Christians supported the government in the civil war, viewing President Bashar al-Assad, a member of a Shiite-derived minority sect, as a protector against rebel fighters mainly drawn from Syria’s Sunni majority.

In the comparatively undamaged parts of the city that had long been held by the government, restaurants were thronged by Christians late into the night.

Hundreds of people danced and celebrated in the Azizya neighborhood, where the public Christmas tree had gone unlit since rebels took the eastern half of the city in 2012.
