	</p><p>International Christian Concern (ICC) has learned that the United States has questioned Mexico regarding reports of widespread discrimination, violence, and displacement of Protestant Christian communities in Chiapas and several other states. In a private e-mail received by ICC last week, Congressional staff members revealed that Assistant Secretary Roberta Jacobson confirmed the questioning of the Mexican government by State Department officials had taken place during the first week of June.
</p><p>Jeff King, ICC's President, said, <em>"It is time that the Mexican government provides justice and protection for victims of religious persecution while dealing with local and state officials that are part of the problem. A slow wave of religious persecution has been sweeping across Mexico and the culture of corruption and lack of accountability that surrounds religious freedom cases needs to end. A free society cannot flourish when religious persecution exists, and this issue has gone on for far too long while the world has looked the other way.  Every citizen of Mexico has a right to practice their faith without the fear of being driven from their homes simply because of what they believe." </em>
