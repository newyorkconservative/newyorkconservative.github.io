<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">               The family of a California woman who was allegedly shot dead by an illegal Mexican immigrant have criticized officials who didn't hand him over after he was jailed just months before the attack.
</span></p>
<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Grieving relatives of Kathryn Steinle, 32, who was shot dead on San Francisco's Pier 14 Thursday night, made the comments in light of revelations that alleged killer Francisco Sanchez, 45, had already been sent back over the border five times.

<p style="background: white;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Immigration officials said that they had made him a 'priority' request for any law enforcement officers who picked him up.
