	</p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Senator Markey has announced his support for the Iran deal that will let the terrorist regime inspect its own Parchin nuclear weapons research site, conduct uranium enrichment, build advanced centrifuges, buy ballistic missiles, fund terrorism and have a near zero breakout time to a nuclear bomb.
</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">There was no surprise there.
</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Markey had topped the list of candidates supported by the Iran Lobby. And the Iranian American Political Action Committee (IAPAC) had maxed out its contributions to his campaign.
</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">After more fake suspense, Al Franken, another IAPAC backed politician who also benefited from Iran Lobby money, came out for the nuke sellout.
</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the Iran Lobby's third Dem senator, didn't bother playing coy like her colleagues. She came out for the deal a while back even though she only got half the IAPAC cash that Franken and Markey received.
</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">As did Senator Gillibrand, who had benefited from IAPAC money back when she first ran for senator and whose position on the deal should have come as no surprise.
</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">The Iran Lobby had even tried, and failed, to turn Arizona Republican Jeff Flake. Iran Lobby cash had made the White House count on him as the Republican who would flip, but Flake came out against the deal. The Iran Lobby invested a good deal of time and money into Schumer, but that effort also failed.
</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Still these donations were only the tip of the Iran Lobby iceberg.
