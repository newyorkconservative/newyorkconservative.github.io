	</p><p>That cross is already there, ready, from the very beginning; we need only take it up. But to keep us from believing that we must simply choose any arbitrary cross, or simply pick out our suffering as we will, Jesus emphasizes that each of us has his or her <em>own</em> cross, ready, appointed, and appropriately measured by God." –Dietrich Bonhoeffer, The Cost of Discipleship</p>
