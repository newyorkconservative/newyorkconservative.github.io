Each year the United States admits one million people with green cards, their dependents and refugees, as well as half a million foreign youths sought by college administrators. <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/15/new-immigration-wave-coming-census-bureau-predicts-1-24-million-more-immigrants-to-enter-usa-in-2015/">Census data</a> projects that, if visas are not slashed or halted, another 14 million immigrant settlers will arrive in the U.S. over the next decade.

Polls from<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/04/23/fox-news-poll-majority-says-legal-immigration-should-be-reduced/"> <em>Fox News</em></a> and <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/171962/decrease-immigration-increase.aspx"><em>Gallup</em></a> show that Americans — by a 2-to-1 ratio — want to see visa issuances reduced. A 2012 Pew Poll found that 69 percent of Americans want to place greater restrictions on who was allowed into the United States.

By the millions, federal visas are shipped out to many of the poorest and least-developed countries. As a consequence of this federal visa policy, today one in four Americans is either an immigrant or a child of an immigrant. Entire states, consider California and its 55 electoral votes, no longer elect Republicans. That’s at least partly because so many visas have been used to bring in foreign citizens who support big government.
