	</p><p style="background: white"><span style="font-size:12pt">Former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer (R) says GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump is making valid claims about illegal immigration's link to violent crime.
</span></p><p style="background: white"><span style="font-size:12pt">Brewer, known best for her own hard-line stance on illigal immigration, defended Trump's controversial rhetoric on Hispanic immigrants during an interview Wednesday night on CNN, according to <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/jan-brewer-arizona-donald-trump-right/2015/07/08/id/654132/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000066">Newsmax</span></a>.
</span></p><p style="background: white"><span style="font-size:12pt">"I believe that Mr. Trump is kind of telling it like it really, truly is," Brewer told host Don Lemon on CNN's "CNN Tonight."
</span></p><p style="background: white"><span style="font-size:12pt">"I think that the people of Arizona realize that we picked up the tab for the majority of the violence that comes across our border in regards to the drug cartels, the smugglers, the drug houses," she added. "It has been horrendous."
</span></p><p style="background: white"><span style="font-size:12pt">Brewer also rejected claims that outsiders understand the daily struggle facing states, like Arizona, that are on the southern border.
</span></p><p style="background: white"><span style="font-size:12pt">"We know from their data — from the federal data — that they only stop or apprehend 1 out of 4 illegal people crossing our border," Brewer said.
