Publicly, New York’s senior senator is keeping his cards close to his chest and complaining about what a difficult decision it is.

My guess is that he’s going to get behind the president, rebuff Israel’s objections and, in the end, vote for appeasement. That’s the implication of a little-noticed YouTube video on which he was last month captured talking with a delegation of Orthodox Jews in Washington.

“We’ve been through this before, we Jewish people,” Schumer said. He then spoke of what a difficult decision he was facing. Noting that he’d been an elected official for 41 years, he said he would not let political pressure interfere.

Yet maybe Schumer will remember Mordechai’s injunction to Esther: “If you remain silent at this time, relief and rescue will arise for the Jews from elsewhere, and you and your father’s household will perish.”
