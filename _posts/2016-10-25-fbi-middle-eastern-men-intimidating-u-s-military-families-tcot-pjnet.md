		</span></p><p style="background: white"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt">An alert has been issued by the FBI to all law enforcement agencies in Colorado and Wyoming involving U.S. military families and concerns about who may be watching them.
</span></p><p style="background: white"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt">The alert says Middle Eastern men are approaching families of U.S. military members at their homes in Colorado and Wyoming. It mentions Greeley and Cheyenne, Wyoming as the specific areas.
</span></p><p style="background: white"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt">In one case last May the wife of a military member was approached in front of her home by two Middle Eastern males. The men stated that she was the wife of a U.S. interrogator. When she denied their claims the men laughed. The two men left the area in a dark-colored, four-door sedan with two other Middle Eastern males in the vehicle.
</span></p><p style="background: white"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:12pt">"The woman had observed the vehicle in the neighborhood on previous occasions," the alert states.
