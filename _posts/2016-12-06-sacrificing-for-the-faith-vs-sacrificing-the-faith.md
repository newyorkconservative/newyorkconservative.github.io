Just as the German bishops hid their crosses, other bishops have been covering up truths about Islam that Christians need to know. Catholic leaders who are sacrificing bits and pieces of the truth for the sake of harmony with Islam should consider the effect of their actions on the growing number of Christians who are suffering persecution at the hands of Muslims. Very often these Christians are given the choice of conversion to Islam or death. If Catholic prelates keep insisting that there is not that much difference between the two faiths, it will be increasingly difficult to resist the temptation to convert.
