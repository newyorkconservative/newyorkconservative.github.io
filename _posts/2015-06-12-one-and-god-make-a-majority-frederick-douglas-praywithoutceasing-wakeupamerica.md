</span></p><p style="background: white"><span style="color:#313131; font-size:10pt">In the Bible book of Joel, in Chapter 2, an ancient Hebrew prophet speaks to a nation in crisis and gives God's solution when He tells them to, "return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning (contrition and humility)" (Joel 2:12).  In that day, the command was for everyone to stop what they were doing and gather for a "sacred assembly," to turn to God with prayer and fasting.
</span></p><p style="background: white"><span style="color:#313131; font-size:10pt">Why did God desire fasting, weeping, and mourning from the people? It provided them with an opportunity to gather before God and acknowledge that their nation had drifted away from its foundations in morality and faith (Joel 2:15). Because of this moral decline, the people were not prepared to face the threats rising up against them and God wanted His people to understand that their moral decline was far greater than the threats of economic crisis or military invasion.
</span></p><p style="background: white"><span style="color:#313131; font-size:10pt">God ordained in that hour of history that prayer would serve as the only way of escape from their mounting troubles. Only God had the power to solve both a nation's internal and external threats. All were unsolvable by human means and human solutions, but God had a solution that could be found in His great mercy.
