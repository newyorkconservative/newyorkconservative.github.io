So how does one prepare for what's coming to America?

"Ground yourself in prayer. Get plugged in, emotionally, intellectually, to the presence of God," he said.

"Decide no matter what the majority does you will follow the Lord. You have decided to follow Jesus, no turning back. God will anoint those who do not compromise. If you want biblical times, you've got it. You want the Book of Acts, it's coming. You want the days of Elijah? It's here. It's time to become the Elijahs of the day. If there's anything in your life that has no business in the life of a saint of God, the time is now, not later, to get it out. Whatever is not in your life that God is calling you to, the time is now to get it in."
