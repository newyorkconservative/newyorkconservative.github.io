	</p><p>The influx of refugees into Europe threatens to undermine the continent's Christian roots and governments must control their borders before they can decide how many asylum seekers they can take, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said.
</p><p>"The people want us to master the situation and protect our borders," he wrote. "Only when we have protected our borders can questions be asked about the numbers of people we can take in, or whether there should be quotas."
</p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Orban said his country was being "overrun" with refugees, adding most were not Christians, but Muslims.
</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">"That is an important question, because Europe and European culture have Christian roots. Or is it not already and in itself alarming that Europe's Christian culture is barely in a position to uphold Europe's own Christian values?" he asked.
