Property records show the mosque attended by the terrorist who <a href="http://nypost.com/2015/07/16/shooting-at-naval-reserve-center-in-tennessee/">killed US soldiers at a base</a> in Chattanooga, Tenn., is affiliated with the same Islamic group as the mosques patronized by the Boston marathon bombers and the 9/11 hijackers who attacked the Pentagon.

Yet federal investigators have dismissed any possibility that the Tennessee mosque was a source of radicalization or support for the terrorist, Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez.
