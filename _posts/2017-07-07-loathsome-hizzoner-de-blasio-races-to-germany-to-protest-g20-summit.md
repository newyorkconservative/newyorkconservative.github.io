Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday skipped an NYPD swearing-in ceremony made somber by <a href="http://nypost.com/2017/07/05/nypd-officer-shot-on-duty-in-critical-condition/">this week’s assassination of a cop</a> — then hours later revealed he was busy preparing to jet off on a surprise trip to <a href="https://thenypost.wordpress.com/2017/07/06/protesters-wreak-havoc-ahead-of-g20-summit-in-germany">join leftist protesters at the G-20 summit</a> in Germany.

Hizzoner’s overseas jaunt was kept under wraps until just 90 minutes before he took off from Newark Airport. A last-minute announcement said he “will attend several events surrounding the G-20 Summit, including Saturday’s Hamburg Zeigt Haltung rally.”

The head of the NYPD sergeants union attacked de Blasio.

“As the city mourns, its leader flees,” Ed Mullins said. “And then he wonders why he has a problem with the police. A real leader stays with the city in this time of hardship.”
