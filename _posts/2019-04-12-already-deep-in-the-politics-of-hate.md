<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trumpâ€™s actions and words last week do seem to portend tougher action on illegal immigration, but one need not look to Nazi Germany for precedents. They may be found in our own history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 1924 immigration act restricted legal immigration into the U.S. and imposed ethnic quotas. That was American, not Nazi, law and was enforced by Presidents Coolidge, Hoover, FDR, Truman, Eisenhower and Kennedy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eisenhower, who led the Allies to victory over Germany, sent Gen. Joseph Swing to the U.S. border to remove a million people who had entered Texas illegally from Mexico, which the general proceeded to do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ike had crushed fascism and understood that securing the homeland against illegal mass migration is fascism only in the minds of those who have forgotten, if ever they knew, what a country is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From his words and actions, Trump clearly senses that this may be the existential issue of his presidency: Can he secure the border against what seems to be an unstoppable invasion from the global south?</p>
