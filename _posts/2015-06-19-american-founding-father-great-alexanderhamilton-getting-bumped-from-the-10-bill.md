“I am outraged to learn of Jack Lew’s proposal to remove Hamilton from the $10 bill,” Lynn Olympia, president of the Alexander Hamilton Historical Society of Kentucky, tells U.S. News in an email. “Lew must be in denial of American history.”

Olympia, an 81-year-old woman, ticked off a number of Hamilton’s achievements – from establishing a system of taxation to his writings in the Federalist Papers and argument for judicial review. She plans to begin circulating petitions to keep Hamilton on the bill around Louisville, Kentucky, hoping to send them to Treasury Secretary Lew.

Hamilton biographer Ron Chernow, <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/06/save-alexander-hamilton-119176.html#.VYQmJPlVhBc">writing an essay for Politico</a>, was also upset.

“There is something sad and shockingly misguided in the spectacle of Treasury Secretary Jack Lew acting to belittle the significance of the foremost Treasury secretary in American history, Alexander Hamilton, by demoting him on the ten-dollar bill,” Chernow expressed, outlining a number of Hamilton's accomplishments.
