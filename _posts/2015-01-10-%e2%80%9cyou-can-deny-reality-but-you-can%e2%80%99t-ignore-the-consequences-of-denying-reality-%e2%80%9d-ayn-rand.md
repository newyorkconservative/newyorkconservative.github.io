	</p><p><em>"Going back to jihad, we cannot consider the "military" interpretation as a falsification of Islam. But we can say that it is carried out only by some Muslims, which does not mean that it is less authentic. It is authentic but not exclusive."</em> â€“ Samir Khalil SAMIR, S.J. from 111 Questions on Islam</p>
