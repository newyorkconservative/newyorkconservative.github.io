</span></p><p style="background: white"><span style="color:#2a2a2a; font-family:Georgia; font-size:12pt">"He doesn't talk about America the way John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan did, about America's greatness and exceptionalism," said Giuliani.
</span></p><p style="background: white"><span style="color:#2a2a2a; font-family:Georgia; font-size:12pt">"He was educated by people who were critics of the US. And he has not been able to overcome those influences."
</span></p><p style="background: white"><span style="color:#2a2a2a; font-family:Georgia; font-size:12pt">Giuliani also implied he was the only one with the chutzpah to call out Obama, saying: "Somebody has to raise these issues with the president. Somebody has to have the courage to stand up."
</span></p><p style="background: white"><span style="color:#2a2a2a; font-family:Georgia; font-size:12pt">Giuliani also bashed Obama for seeming to focus more attention on the police shooting in Missouri, which, he said, "turned out to be justified," than the killings by Islamic fanatics. "How could you hold a press conference about Ferguson and not hold a press conference when Christians and Jews were slaughtered?" he asked.
