Our Bill of Rights explicitly gives Americans the right to bear arms.

Ratified on 12/15/1791 the Second Amendment states that "A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a Free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."

The importance of this right may be observed by noting that it’s second.

The NRA is the Nation’s foremost defender of that right.

For some reason whenever there is a mass shooting, there is an emotional and highly irrational response to attack the NRA and the Bill of Rights.

It's as if the NRA was either responsible or somehow complicit in the mass shooting.

In the last mass shooting - the Valentine’s Day massacre on Ash Wednesday - it has been revealed that there were dozens of warning signs that were ignored by the killer’s foster parents, the school, the local community, the FBI and local law enforcement.

The day of the massacre there were also several catastrophic breakdowns in the reaction to the shooting itself including an armed officer who shirked his duties and stood outside the school while the shooting took place.

Let's now look at De Blasio's NYC for a minute - what we read about in NYC on a daily basis are guns that have been acquired illegally and used illegally to commit crimes on the innocent law abiding people of the City.

Today for example you can read about a Dongan Hill man being arrested with a gun and bullets <a href="http://www.silive.com/news/2018/03/nypd_touts_gun_seizure_during.html">http://www.silive.com/news/2018/03/nypd_touts_gun_seizure_during.html</a>

You can make the argument that the citizens of NYC would benefit if this City had more respect for the Second Amendment and would provide more trust to the good people of NYC to more easily carry and bear arms.

It is shameful that the annual Staten Island Friends of the NRA fundraiser at The Vanderbilt has been cancelled.

<a href="http://www.silive.com/news/2018/03/island_nra_benefit_cancelled_b.html">http://www.silive.com/news/2018/03/island_nra_benefit_cancelled_b.html</a>

There are many good and law abiding people in Staten Island that believe that the Second Amendment, defined by our Bill of Rights, IS THEIR RIGHT.

Many in law enforcement, NYPD, active and ex-military live on Staten Island.

There are also many who hunt that live on the Island and believe in the sport that the Second Amendment affords.

There are also many people on Staten Island that just happen to believe in our Bill of Rights.

Donald Trump - a New Yorker, our President and a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment won in a landslide here!

Why some, like Diane Savino and Debi Rose, have taken pride that they have shutdown their fellow Americans rights to freely assemble and enjoy an evening out with an organization that they belong to or associate with is stunning and shameful.

I really hope that the NRA will find another place to conduct their business on the Island and that the venue will have enough backbone to stand up for the Bill of Rights and fellow Staten Islanders freedom.

The irony of this is that the Bill of Rights was specifically put in place through other Amendments to check the mob mentality of these kinds of people, who will not think twice, about trampling on someone else’s rights so long as they have their way.
