<p>The following peculiarities also lack compelling explanations:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. Late on election night, with Trump comfortably ahead, many swing states stopped counting ballots. In most cases, observers were removed from the counting facilities. Counting generally continued without the observers</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. Statistically abnormal vote counts were the new normal when counting resumed. They were unusually large in size (hundreds of thousands) and had an unusually high (90 percent and above) Biden-to-Trump ratio</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. Late arriving ballots were counted. In Pennsylvania, 23,000 absentee ballots have impossible postal return dates and another 86,000 have such extraordinary return dates they raise serious questions</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>4. The failure to match signatures on mail-in ballots. The destruction of mail in ballot envelopes, which must contain signatures</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>5. Historically low absentee ballot rejection rates despite the massive expansion of mail voting. Such is Biden’s narrow margin that, as political analyst Robert Barnes observes, ‘If the states simply imposed the same absentee ballot rejection rate as recent cycles, then Trump wins the election’</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>6. Missing votes. In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, 50,000 votes held on 47 USB cards are missing</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>7. Non-resident voters. Matt Braynard’s Voter Integrity Project estimates that 20,312 people who no longer met residency requirements cast ballots in Georgia. Biden’s margin is 12,670 votes</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>8. Serious ‘chain of custody’ breakdowns. Invalid residential addresses. Record numbers of dead people voting. Ballots in pristine condition without creases, that is, they had not been mailed in envelopes as required by law</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>9. Statistical anomalies. In Georgia, Biden overtook Trump with 89 percent of the votes counted. For the next 53 batches of votes counted, Biden led Trump by the same exact 50.05 to 49.95 percent margin in every single batch. It is particularly perplexing that all statistical anomalies and tabulation abnormalities were in Biden’s favor. Whether the cause was simple human error or nefarious activity, or a combination, clearly something peculiar happened.</p>
