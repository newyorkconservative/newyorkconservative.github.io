Westerners, according to liberalism, should allow the leaders of Islam to dictate the limits of free speech. If they deem something offensive, then Westerners should fall silent. No other religion under liberalism enjoys such protection. When Christians cry foul, liberals dismiss their complaints as meritless and accuse them of intolerance and rigidity. Liberals treat Jesus as a mere man, whom they feel free to describe as married in artistic productions, while condemning depictions of Muhammad as if he is God.<br/></span>
