For the past several weeks it seemed as if Germany had truly become the promised land for Mideast asylum seekers, primarily those seeking to escape the Syrian civil (and global proxy) war, but <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-09-11/europe-flooded-reports-isis-terrorists-posing-refugees">according to various media reports</a>, also a material number of "ISIS-linked terrorists." Then it all came crashing down earlier today when Germany's <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2015/09/merkel%20mother.jpg">beloved by all refugees "Mutti</a>" said <em>genug</em>, and with one decision shut <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-09-13/germany-reintroduces-border-controls-austria-sends-riot-police-refugee-crisis-spiral">down the border with Austria </a>in the process unraveling decades of customs-union progress (following promptly by the <a href="http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-police-toughen-measures-on-austrian-border-due-to-refugees/1258000">Czech Republic doing the same</a>, with Italy expected to follow suit in the hours ahead).

Ironically, just as Europe is shutting its doors to Syrian refugees, the US is opening its own.
