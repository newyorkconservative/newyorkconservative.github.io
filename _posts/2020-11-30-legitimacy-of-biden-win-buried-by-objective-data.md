<p>During the weeks following November 3rd, innumerable election experts and statistical analysts have pored over the voting data upon which former Vice President Joe Biden’s purported campaign victory ostensibly stands. A growing body of evidence ranging from straightforward ballot audits to complex quantitative analyses suggests that the tabulation of the votes was characterized by enough chicanery to alter the outcome of the election. Consequently, a consensus has gradually developed among the auditors of publicly available information released by the states, and it <em>contradicts</em> the narrative promulgated by the Democrats and the media. The more data experts see, the less convinced they are that Biden won.</p>

<p>No fewer than six precincts listed by Rep. Posey experienced turnout exceeding 120%. Another 10 allegedly enjoyed 100% turnout. This is an insult to the electorate’s intelligence, and it happened in Democrat precincts all across the nation. From WWII through 2016 average turnout in a presidential election was about 56%. Yet we are expected to believe that, in 2020, the national <a href="http://www.electproject.org/2020g">turnout</a> was 66%. It simply does not pass the laugh test. This is obviously the result of widespread Democrat chicanery facilitated by high-handed flouting of federal, state and county election laws. Joe Biden’s victory is no more legitimate than his plagiarized rhetoric or working class credentials. His Potemkin presidency would be no more authentic than the man himself.</p>
