	</p><p><span style="color:#663300">"Do not be afraid to go out on the streets and into public places, like the first Apostles who preached Christ and the Good News of salvation in the squares of cities, towns and villages. This is no time to be ashamed of the Gospel (Cfr. <em>Rom</em> 1,16<span style="font-family:Tahoma">
			</span>). It is the time to preach it from the rooftops (Cfr. <em>Matth</em> 10,27<span style="font-family:Tahoma">
			</span>). Do not be afraid to break out of comfortable and routine modes of living, in order to take up the challenge of making Christ known in the modern "metropolis". It is you who must "go out into the byroads" (<span style="font-family:Tahoma">
			</span><em>Matth</em> 22,9<span style="font-family:Tahoma">
			</span>) and invite everyone you meet to the banquet which God has prepared for his people. The Gospel must not be kept hidden because of fear or indifference. It was never meant to be hidden away in private. It has to be put on a stand so that people may see its light and give praise to our heavenly Father."
