 </p><p><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:12pt">Once again Mark Levin, the constitutional scholar and radio talk show host, has written an important book that should be in the library of every thoughtful conservative. But this book is different, in that thoughtful conservatives should buy multiple copies and bestow the extras on younger people they care about. For in its essence, this book is a call to arms for the generation that will inherit the wreckage being created by what Levin calls the "ruling generation" – the holders of political power and those who sustain them in office. The younger age cohorts are the people whose future has been "plundered" (Levin's choice of title is apt) by the policies advanced by progressives and acquiesced to by establishment Republicans.</span><span style="font-family:Trebuchet MS"><br /><br /><a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2015/07/mark_levins_emplunder_and_deceitem.html" /></span>http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2015/07/mark_levins_emplunder_and_deceitem.html</span>
