	</p><p>We <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/03/12/would-the-white-house-really-try-to-get-around-the-constitution/">surmised yesterday</a> that the Obama administration had the idea to go to the United Nations to pass by resolution what Congress would never agree to: a lifting of sanctions on Iran in exchange for a nearly worthless deal in which Iran would keep thousands of centrifuges and get a 10-year glide path to nuclear breakout. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), seeing what was afoot, <a href="http://www.corker.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/4f2cb34c-4908-4e0e-9f29-6537ab3adc5a/Corker%20Letter%20to%20President%20Obama%20on%20Iran%20Nuclear%20Deal.pdf">demanded an explanation</a> from the White House, calling such a scheme an "affront to the American people."
