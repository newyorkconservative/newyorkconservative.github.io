	</p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">The laws of several western countries, besides the Islamic ones themselves, do not permit anything critical to be said of Islam. Such laws forbid what is called "hate speech." They often include other sub-groups like homosexuals, women, or race. Such laws and customs have practically reduced responsible freedom of speech to a dead letter. Fines and jail sentences are meted out if such laws are violated.
</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Such laws are generally based on a civil peace idea rooted in Thomas Hobbes. That is, violence is caused by religious and philosophical controversy. The only way to prevent it is by a civil law forbidding any expression of "hatred." This approach explains why civil authority is hostile to honest analysis of what religion or philosophy actually holds. Such a law becomes particularly dangerous when we are not permitted to speak objectively about Islam. Criticism, satire, or disagreement with its tenets will often be answered by Islamic violence. Rather than inquire whether this critical analysis is valid, it is simply forbidden. The accuracy of the criticism is irrelevant.
