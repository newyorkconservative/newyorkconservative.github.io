  “Then I saw thrones; those who sat on
  them were entrusted with judgment. I
  also saw the souls of those who had been
  beheaded for their witness to Jesus and
  for the word of God, and who had not
  worshiped the beast or its image nor had
  accepted its mark on their foreheads or
  hands. They came to life and they
  reigned with Christ for a thousand
  years.”
