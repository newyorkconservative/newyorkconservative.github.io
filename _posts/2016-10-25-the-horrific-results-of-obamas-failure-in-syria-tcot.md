And Obama wanted nothing to interfere with the prospects for a nuclear deal with Iran. He was, as Hof has said, “<a title="www.businessinsider.com" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/former-senior-administration-official-the-us-needs-a-syria-strategy-that-isnt-counterproductive-2015-6">reluctant to offend</a> the Iranians at this critical juncture.” So the effective concession of Syria as an Iranian zone of influence is just one more cost of the president’s legacy nuclear agreement.
