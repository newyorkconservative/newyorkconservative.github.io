<p>Here are the facts. We know that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/PA.html" target="_blank">2.6 million mail-in ballots have been counted</a> in the Pennsylvania election returns, in addition to nearly 4.2 million Election Day votes. We also know from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.electionreturns.pa.gov/" target="_blank">secretary of state</a> that Trump won Election Day votes, 2.7 million to 1.4 million. But we are to believe that Biden won 76% of mail-in ballots.</p>
