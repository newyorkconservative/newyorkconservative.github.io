</span></p><p><span style="color:#222222;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:10pt">Projections show the center will likely receive 300 refugees from around the world during the upcoming federal fiscal year. That's the same number as this year.
</span></p><p><span style="color:#222222;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:10pt">Refugee Center director Zeze Rwasama anticipates the biggest populations of newcomers will be from Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</span></p><p><span style="color:#222222;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:10pt">"That can change at any time depending on what's out there," he said. The U.S. Department of State approves the number of refugees coming to Twin Falls.
</span></p><p><span style="color:#222222;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:10pt">There aren't any Syrians in Twin Falls yet, Rwasama said, but the Refugee Center is prepared for the influx. "We're not anticipating any challenges."
