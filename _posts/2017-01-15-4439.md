Moral relativism, Schneider added, brings about an inversion of the prayer, “Thy will be done” found in the Our Father, instead substituting “May my will be done, and may your will no longer be done.”

“‘Relativism’ means that there are no absolute or permanent norms,” Schneider said. “That is relativism, that we can do this and that, that they’re the same. But this is contrary to divine revelation. This is a lie. Relativism is a lie. It’s not true. There is only one truth.”
