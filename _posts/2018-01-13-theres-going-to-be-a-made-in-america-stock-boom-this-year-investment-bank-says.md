The stock market will enjoy a "Made in America" boom this year thanks to a slew of policies spearheaded by the Trump administration, according to a Wall Street investment bank.

Some of the nation's largest industrial and steel companies will rally under President Donald Trump's focus on domestic prosperity, spelling even more upside for investors, according to Jefferies.

With the U.S. thinking about leaving NAFTA, "new tax incentives to repatriate profits in place and the dollar weak, the ingredients for a domestic investment boom are in place," analyst Sean Darby wrote Thursday. "While the corporate sector is obviously euphoric over the tax changes, it is not often highlighted that it has improved U.S.'s competitive position."
