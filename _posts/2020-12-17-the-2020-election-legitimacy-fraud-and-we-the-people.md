<p>To the members of the Houses, Senates and the Justices in the Courts entrusted to uphold the Rule of Law <em>(State and Federal) </em>-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The legitimacy of the President of the United States comes from the <strong><em><u>"CONSENT"</u></em></strong> of the Governed - that is - <strong><em><u>"WE THE PEOPLE."</u></em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Legitimacy <strong>“CANNOT”</strong></em> come through <strong><em><u>“MASS ELECTION FRAUD.”</u></em></strong><br><br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For that simple <strong><em><u>"FACT"</u></em></strong> irrespective of how events play out over the next few weeks, Joe Biden can <strong><em><u>"NEVER"</u></em></strong> be the <strong><em><u>"LEGITIMATE"</u></em></strong> President of the United States.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>President Donald J Trump won this election in a landslide.<br><br>The question is a simple one but with massive implications – <em>Will our elected officials and trusted public servants stand by and passively allow an illegitimate candidate to ascend to the highest office in our land? Or will they rise to the occasion and defend the Constitution of the United States of America?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The Founding Fathers gave us the necessary checks and balances, as well as constitutional tools, to deal with the very type of fraudulent election that has just been perpetrated on the American people.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2020 what “We the People” have been put through, a year’s long abuse of our civil liberties, culminating with a fraudulent Presidential election has crossed a line that there is no going back from and cannot be tolerated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is one thought that both haunts and particularly disgusts me that I would like to share.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Veterans Day passed this year, as I was thinking about this fraudulent election, I was also thinking about the brave men who fought throughout our history, risking everything to procure us with our sacred freedoms and civil liberties.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then I thought about how truly little we expect from our politicians and judges. We are not asking them to get on a battlefield and risk their lives. All we are asking them to do is to do their duty and oath in following and upholding the law.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Texas attorney general said it best in their petition to the Supreme Court – “</p>

We ask the Court to choose the former.”</em></a><em></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We the People now ask our trusted servants in Congress to do the same.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Sincerely,</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>We the People - The Association of the Sons of Liberty of New York</em></p>

<p>Regarding the evidence of election fraud it is both obvious and overwhelming – it is virtually impossible that Joe Biden could have won this election -</p>
