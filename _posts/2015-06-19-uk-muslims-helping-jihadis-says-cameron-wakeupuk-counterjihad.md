<p class="mol-para-with-font"><span id="ext-gen143">Too many British Muslims ‘quietly condone’ extremism, David Cameron will say today.</span></p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font"><span id="ext-gen142">In a blunt speech, he will urge families to speak out against the ‘poisonous ideology’ driving hundreds of young people to wage jihad for Islamic State.</span></p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">The Prime Minister will also call for parents to stop blaming police and the security services for failing to prevent British teenagers heading to Syria.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Parts of the Muslim community are guilty of normalising hatred of democracy and western values, he warns – making it easier for violent extremism to take hold.</p>
