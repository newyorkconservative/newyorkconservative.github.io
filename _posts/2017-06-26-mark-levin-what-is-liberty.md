“Let me ask you some questions,” Conservative Review Editor-in-Chief Mark Levin said Monday evening on the radio.

Everywhere you look in this country, progressivism put into practice through big government is failing. Yet the progressive Democrats continue to institute their policies, and Republicans seem complicit in the growth of government. “How do we explain all this?” Levin asked. “What is this all about?”

Levin embarked on in an in-depth discussion of the roots of progressivism and of the rejection of the political theory of the American founding by progressives in both the Republican and Democratic parties. What is liberty? What are natural rights? Why have the leading progressive intellectuals attacked our founding principles and our republican system?

These questions are fundamental to understanding how to preserve our liberty. These are the themes Levin writes about in his new book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rediscovering-Americanism-Progressivism-Mark-Levin/dp/1476773084">Rediscovering Americanism: And the Tyranny of Progressivism</a>,” available everywhere tomorrow.
