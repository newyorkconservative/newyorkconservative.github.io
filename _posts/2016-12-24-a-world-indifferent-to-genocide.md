Earlier this month, a suicide bomber killed 25 Christian worshippers at Cairo’s Coptic cathedral complex during Sunday Mass. Every act of terror is outrageous, but targeting a religious service sends a very definite message — you will be killed because of the God you choose to worship. That’s a message Jews have heard throughout time.

It was the latest in a long series of attacks that have killed tens of thousands of Christians living in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Nigeria and Egypt. It has created a tidal wave of millions of refugees that is undermining the European continent. Christians have been tortured and murdered in the most medieval ways by groups like ISIS and Boko Haram.

Entire Christian communities, in the lands where Christianity began, have disappeared. While the vast majority of the victims in the most recent conflict are Sunni Arabs, Christians have been an ongoing target for decades.

The entire Christian community of Nineveh in Northern Iraq could be completely gone in four years. These are the people who speak Aramaic, the same language spoken by Jesus of Nazareth, with Christian roots that go back that far.

These horrific scenes make headlines but are soon forgotten — a poignant lesson in the silence Jews have long suffered under.

Mere words have never stopped genocide. They must be backed up by action.

At a minimum, humanitarian aid should not be hampered, as it has been. Water, food, blankets and medical supplies promised more than two years ago by the United States and United Nations to the northern regions of Iraq have still not reached the Christian enclaves. There is no excuse.

Christmas is the season of hope and goodwill toward man. Hanukkah is the holiday of miracles. Both celebrate the victory of light over darkness. It strikes us that the world needs all four this year, and we’d add one more. Let’s end the silence, and tell the world in the strongest possible terms that this outrage against humanity must end — and it must end now.
