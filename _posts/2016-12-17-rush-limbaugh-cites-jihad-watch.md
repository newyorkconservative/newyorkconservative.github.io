Besides Angela Merkel and Obama, you gotta put the pope right in there with world leaders who are helping to spread and sanction this whole idea of Islamic supremacism based on the fact that we all need to share Islamic guilt.  Comparing Jesus to the invaders of Europe who are committing all of these atrocities?

My gosh, the left has just infected everything that it has touched.  It’s a poison.  Christmas reminds us that Jesus was a migrant.  Yeah, I remember when Jesus killed 130 people in Paris.  I remember when Jesus wiped out people in San Bernardino.  And I remember when Jesus attacked the military at Fort Hood.  Yeah.  I remember when Jesus hijacked three airplanes and flew them into the World Trade Center.  What kind of insanity is this?  It’s everywhere, and it’s all because Hillary Clinton lost the election.
