Pat Buchanan went on <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/hannity/">Hannity</a> to discuss the state of the Republican primary race.

After New York and with the elections next week, Donald Trump has <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/04/sean-hannity-strikes-back-airs-video-cruz-telling-kasich-quit-playing-spoiler/">the only path</a> to win the nomination. Cruz and Kasich are both just playing spoilers at this point.

Pat Buchanan: I think any Republican, major figure in the Republican Party who walks away, who walks away when Trump is the nominee and says, “I’m not endorsing him and I don’t really care if he loses,” is going to be just like the folks in ’64, Rockefeller and Romney, Scranton and all the rest. And after that they were ancient history, Sean. Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan went all out for Goldwater when he was 50 points behind. Nixon traveled to more states, I think, than Goldwater did. They fought for the party and when the party went down to defeat they were right there standing with their guy. The future belonged to them, because of that and it didn’t belong to the guys who walked away and went over the hill.
