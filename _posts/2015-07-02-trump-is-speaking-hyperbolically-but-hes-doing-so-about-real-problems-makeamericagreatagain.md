<div>When somebody sufficiently high-profile speaks in the “rest-of-America” language long enough, it’s just a matter of time before they say something the progressive aristocracy deems “beyond the pale” and requiring economic censure in the form of firing, not just social censure in the form of “what a jerky thing to say.” The pale is getting awfully small these days. In progressive aristocracy America, it’s ipso facto xenophobic to point out that quite a few violent criminals enter the United States across our insufficiently-guarded borders.</div>
