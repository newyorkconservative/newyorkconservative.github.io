	</p><p><span style="font-size:12pt">In October 2001, the United States Congress passed a joint resolution designating that every September 11th be observed as "Patriot Day."  The resolution requests that  U.S. government entities and interested organizations and individuals display the flag of the United States at half staff on Patriot Day and that the people of the United States observe a moment of silence  in honor of the individuals who lost their lives as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
