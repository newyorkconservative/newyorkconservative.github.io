<p>We appear to be at the beginning of a massive crackdown on people who have supported Donald Trump, led by big tech and big media. These entities are making Trump into an example of <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2021/01/08/media-outrage-over-capitol-riot-isnt-about-defending-democracy-its-about-wielding-power/">their power</a> to frighten the half of America that supported him in November. We cannot allow them to intimidate us.</p>

<p>But they sure are trying, and on some, they will succeed. They are using the excuse of an unrepresentative group of fools criminally ransacking U.S. Capitol offices with a lighter touch than many of this summerâ€™s often unpunished Black Lives Matter and Antifa rioters. Remember: Some of those rioters <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/08/26/dad-of-seattle-shooting-victim-files-3b-in-claims-against-city/"><em>got away with</em> murder</a>, attacking <a href="https://apnews.com/2ed5ad6a436febbcc75761639e6e214b">public buildings</a> including <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/activists-kenosha-move-carefully-us-capitol-chaos-75119309">in state capitols</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/expert-andy-ngo-it-wasnt-antifa-at-the-capitol-riots">arson</a>, and <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2020/09/13/as-two-l-a-police-officers-fight-for-their-lives-protesters-scream-we-hope-they-die/">stopping ambulances</a> from bringing wounded police into hospitals for treatment. They were <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2021/01/07/28-times-media-and-democrats-excused-or-endorsed-violence-committed-by-left-wing-activists/">bailed out</a> with the help of the incoming Democrat vice president.</p>
