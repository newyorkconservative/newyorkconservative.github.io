</span></p><p style="background: white"><a href="http://www.clickorlando.com/news/oia-to-open-muslim-prayer-room/34659496" target="_blank"><span style="font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline">WKMG-TV</span></a><span style="font-size:12pt"> reports the airport will spend $250,000 to build the "Reflection Room" where Muslims can pray. The airport decided to build the room after Emirates Airlines announced it will make non-stop flights from Orlando to Dubai.

</span></p><p style="background: white"><span style="font-size:12pt">Many Muslims currently pray in public, and even the bathrooms, at the Orlando airport. Carolyn Fennell, director of public affairs at the airport, says the "Reflective Room" will give them a much more suitable place to pray.
