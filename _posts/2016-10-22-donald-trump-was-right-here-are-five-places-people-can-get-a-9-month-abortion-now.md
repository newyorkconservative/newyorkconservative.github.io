Below are FIVE places where women can get abortions through the NINTH MONTH of pregnancy, RIGHT NOW!

<strong>1. Southwestern Women’s Options, Albuquerque, New Mexico</strong>
<strong>Abortionists: Shelley Sella, Susan Robinson, Carmen Landau, Curtis Boyd, Emily Rothman</strong>
New Mexico is the “Wild West” for late-term abortionists because there are essentially no laws restricting the practice or regulating it. This facility is the largest late-term abortion facility in the U.S. It uses the Induction Abortion technique for most late-term abortions, which is a modified “partial birth abortion” procedure. <a href="http://www.operationrescue.org/archives/new-docs-reveal-horrific-details-of-botched-35-week-abortion-gross-negligence-in-nm-disciplinary-case/" target="_blank">Documentation</a> exists that provide details of a severely botched 35-week abortion there in 2011, which ruptured the uterus of the patient.

<strong>2. Boulder Abortion Clinic, Boulder, Colorado
Owned and operated by Warren Hern</strong>
Like New Mexico, Colorado law allows for abortions through all nine months of pregnancy. Hern has written text books on abortion and even invented new abortion instruments over his long career. According to a <a href="http://abortiondocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hern-case-complaint-2015-1.pdf" target="_blank">Federal Court lawsuit</a> filed in Colorado, one patient suffered a horrific THIRD TRIMESTER dismemberment abortion complication in 2013, wherein a four-centimeter slightly curved section of bone from her aborted baby’s skull was left inside her and became imbedded in her uterus. She may never bear another child.

<strong>3. Women’s Med Center, Dayton, Ohio
Owned and operated by Martin Haskell</strong>
Haskell has been credited with inventing the partial birth abortion procedure, although that claim is in dispute. Haskell’s abortion facility has had a number of documented botched abortions. Most recently, information surfaced that his facility conducted a <a href="http://www.operationrescue.org/archives/overdosed-woman-aborted-without-consent-at-haskells-late-term-abortion-facility/" target="_blank">forced late-term abortion</a> on a woman who was incapable of consenting. He has had issues maintaining his abortion facility license since he cannot qualify for a hospital transfer agreement as required by law. He currently operates under a variance that allows him an exemption from the transfer agreement requirement.

<strong>4. Pro-Choice Medical Center, Beverly Hills, California
Owned and operated by Josepha Seletz</strong>
Seletz uses the Induction Abortion method for very late-term abortions, which she will gladly do in the event of a “fetal anomaly.” She boasts of being “the most experienced abortion provider in the Western United States.”

<strong>5. Germantown Reproductive Health Services, Germantown, Maryland</strong>
<strong>Abortionist: LeRoy Carhart</strong>
While late-term abortions are inherently more risky than the first trimester variety, LeRoy Carhart is among the worst late-term abortionists in the nation. He is responsible for the deaths of two late-term abortion patients: <a href="http://www.operationrescue.org/archives/operation-rescue-files-formal-complaint-against-carhart-with-md-medical-board-in-patient-death/" target="_blank">Jennifer Morbelli</a>, 29, who died of complications to a 33-week abortion on February 7, 2013, and <a href="http://www.operationrescue.org/noblog/in-memory-of-christin-gilbert-1985-2005/" target="_blank">Christin Gilbert</a>, 19, who died from a third trimester Carhart abortion in Kansas in 2005. Numerous life-threatening <a href="http://www.operationrescue.org/archives/videos-911-calls-confirm-carhart-nearly-killed-one-abortion-patient-seriously-injured-another/" target="_blank">botched abortions</a> have characterized the past few years of his career. Carhart has been <a href="http://www.operationrescue.org/archives/carhart-subpoenas-seek-records-of-baby-parts-trafficking-aborted-babies-born-alive/" target="_blank">subpoenaed</a> by the House Select Panel on Infant Lives, which suspects Carhart has illegally trafficked in aborted baby body parts and had babies born alive at his abortion facility.
