	</p><p>Washington, D.C. â€“ U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand announced new bipartisan legislation, known as the Transparency for the Families of 9/11 Victims and Survivors Act of 2015 that would require President Obama to declassify and make publicly available the redacted 28 pages from the Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 2001. The legislation was introduced today by U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), and also cosponsored by Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), along with U.S. Representatives Walter Jones (R-NC), Stephen F. Lynch (D-MA), and Thomas Massie (R-KY). Gillibrand is an original co-sponsor of the legislation.
</p><p>"If avoiding another 9/11 is going to be the justification for involving us in more wars in the Middle East, then the American people need a complete picture of what enabled 9/11," said Representative Massie. "The declassification of these 28 pages will reshape our foreign policy in the Middle East. Based on my reading of the documents, I am confident that making these 28 pages public would enhance, not harm, national security. I look forward to continue this effort with Senator Paul, Representative Jones, and Representative Lynch and urge my colleagues to read the pages and cosponsor H. Res. 14 in the House and S. 1471 in the Senate."
