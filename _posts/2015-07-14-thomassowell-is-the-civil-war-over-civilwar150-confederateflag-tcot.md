	</p><p style="background: white"><span style="color:black; font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Professional race hustlers have no incentive to see our current civil war end. Now there are rumblings of demands that statues of Robert E. Lee and other Southern leaders be destroyed â€” and if that is done, it will only lead to new demands, perhaps to destroy the Jefferson Memorial because Thomas Jefferson owned slaves. And if that is done, no doubt there will be demands that the city of Washington be renamed, for the same reason.
</span></p><p style="background: white"><span style="color:black; font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">In short, there is no stopping point, just unending strife as far out as the eye can see. And just what will that accomplish? It could ultimately accomplish the killer's dream of racial polarization and violence.
</span></p><p style="background: white"><span style="color:black; font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">Neither blacks nor whites will be better off if that happens. 
</span></p><p style="background: white"><span style="color:black; font-family:Arial; font-size:12pt">With all the very real problems in this society, can we really spare the time and the wasted energy of trying to refight a Civil War that ended before our great-grandparents were born?
