<a href="https://www.newyorkconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/robert-mueller-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4624" src="https://www.newyorkconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/robert-mueller-2.jpg" alt="robert-mueller-2" width="640" height="423" /></a>

In the backdrop of the Valentine’s Day Massacre on Wednesday where 17 people were slaughtered at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Florida, most of them children, Robert Mueller released information of an indictment of 13 Russians for waging information warfare to impact the 2016 election.

Government resources are being severely misappropriated – the same bureaucrats that ignored a tip that could have saved the lives of 17 Americans in Florida are wasting precious time and resources focusing on Russian twitter and facebook accounts while ignoring social media posts of “real people” threatening mass violence like the Florida killer had done.

Americans are smarter than the bureaucrats who are trying to set the narrative. Let’s look at this - twitter and facebook are full of garbage and fakenews - but it is up to the voter to decide where they want to get their information from. Who ever said to turn to twitter and or facebook to obtain your news? Yes they provide some good links and many reputable people use these mediums but it is up to the American voter to decide what to believe and not believe.

The same is true with assembling with a group of people that are hitting the streets to champion a cause or peacefully assemble in protest. Who is the group you are going to join? Who funds them? What is their real motive? It is up to each American to do their homework.

As the media goes crazy about this latest revelation of the Mueller investigation, those same hypocrites will not even “bat an eye” when it comes to George Soros who funnels billions of dollars into radical left wing causes across the Nation – Soros is constantly meddling and interfering in US elections with billions behind him, Anti-American propaganda, half-truths and lies.

Recall the article by Asra Q. Nomani,

"Billionaire George Soros has ties to more than 50 ‘partners’ of the Women’s March on Washington"

George Soros has done far more damage and meddling in our Democracy than anyone else yet is left completely unchecked. Where is the investigation into him?

The greatest attack to our Democracy right now is the Robert Mueller Special Council because it lingers in the shadows and it is working to cast doubt on a freely elected President. It is causing confusion and providing half-truths in a very calculated manner to attack and confuse the American people.

The primary purpose of the special council was to investigate any illegal activity between Trumps campaign and the Russians. Instead they disclosed information on Friday which has nothing to do with this and they continue to do so.

Why not complete the entire investigation and come back with one simple conclusion? Did Trump collude with the Russians to get elected President and if so how? And if he did not then exonerate his name, anything less is an injustice.
