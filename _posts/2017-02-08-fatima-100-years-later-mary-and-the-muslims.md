Catholics ought to pray for the conversion of Islam just as they once prayed for the conversion of Russia. Catholics also need to inform themselves. If Muslims are ever to be converted away from Islam in large numbers, Catholics will need to gain a more realistic perspective on Islam. I have suggested that Bishop Sheen was overly optimistic about the prospects for Muslim conversions, but he was also a realist—far more realistic about Islam than many of today’s bishops. Consider this passage from his chapter on “Mary and Moslems”:

At the present time, the hatred of the Moslem countries against the West is becoming a hatred against Christianity itself … there is still grave danger that the temporal power of Islam may return and, with it, the menace that it may shake off a West which has ceased to be Christian, and affirm itself as a great anti-Christian world power.

“Hatred against Christianity,” “menace,” “anti-Christian world power.” Very few bishops today would dare to use that kind of language about Islam. Yet, today there is a much greater warrant for that view than there was in Sheen’s day. Sheen was optimistic about the chances for Muslim conversion, but he also had fears about Islam’s return as an anti-Christian power. At this point in time, it looks as though his fears are being realized. Some of the blame for that rests on the shoulders of Catholic leaders who have adopted an attitude of wishful thinking about Islam. If Sheen’s hopes are ever to be realized, they need to discard their gauzy view of Islam and replace it with a realistic perspective.

They could start by focusing less on the supposed similarities between Islam and Christianity, and more on the differences. They might, for instance, concentrate on the fact that, for a growing number of young Muslim men, the only virgins they are devoted to are the seventy-two that Allah has reserved for them in paradise.
