<span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">The term "sanctuary" conjures up a place of safety and comfort and, indeed, in some dictionaries, those two terms are used to describe sanctuaries. Therefore pairing the two terms, "violent" and "sanctuary" in the same title may seem to constitute a contradiction in terms. As you will soon see, in this era of political corruption and intentional ineptitude, those two terms actually fit perfectly together.

<span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">While the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary in part, describes aÂ sanctuary as, "a refuge for wildlife where predators are controlled and hunting is illegal" in so-called "Sanctuary Cities" such as San Francisco, <em>predators</em> are being granted sanctuary and <em>innocent people are being hunted</em>. Witness the senseless murder of Kathryn Steinle who fell victim to a predatory criminal alien, Francisco Sanchez, who easily entered the United States by running our borders with impunity on at least five occasions notwithstanding the fact that he has reportedly been convicted of committing seven felonies in the United States and yet was shielded by San Francisco's sanctuary policies.
