President Donald Trump fulfilled a key campaign promise, when he signed an executive order Wednesday restricting the number of visas for <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-exclusive-idUSKBN1582XQ" target="_blank">foreign</a> nationals from terrorist hotbeds attempting to come into the United States. According <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-exclusive-idUSKBN1582XQ" target="_blank">to Reuters</a>, the list of countries affected includes Iran, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, and Yemen.

President Trump’s “Protecting the Nation from Terrorist Attacks by Foreign Nationals” <a href="http://documents.latimes.com/read-draft-copy-president-trumps-executive-order-immigration-and-refugees/" target="_blank">executive order</a> is expected to put particular focus on blocking individuals from the Middle East and north Africa — with special exceptions for persecuted religious minorities  — until an established vetting program is put in place.
