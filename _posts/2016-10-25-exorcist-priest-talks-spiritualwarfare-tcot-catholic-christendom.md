<a href="https://www.catholiccompany.com/popular-authors-and-people-c276/" target="_blank">Pope Francis</a> has mentioned the devil in his homilies frequently, warning us against his infernal tactics to turn us away from God. Our headlines are filled with evidence of cultural unrest and societal decay in many parts of the world, including our own. ISIS is on the march and leaving scores of martyred Christians in their wake. The Church is enduring scandal and confusion is spreading.

So, it’s not surprising that people are noticing that the devil is keeping busy, and as a result are showing greater interest in spiritual warfare. In fact, one of our most popular-selling books currently is the <a href="https://www.catholiccompany.com/getfed/new-catholic-book-manual-for-spiritual-warfare/" target="_blank"><strong><em>Manual for Spiritual Warfare</em></strong></a>  which contains wisdom and prayers of the saints who persevered in the devil’s battle for their souls.
