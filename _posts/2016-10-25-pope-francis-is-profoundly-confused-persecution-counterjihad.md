Now he is contradicting himself. “The Pope went on, however, to acknowledge that the ‘idea of conquest is inherent to the soul of Islam,’ while immediately adding that ‘one could also interpret the end of Saint Matthew’s gospel, where Jesus sends out his disciples to all nations, as the same idea of conquest.’ It wasn’t clear whether the Pope actually believes that Jesus’ mandate to his disciples to evangelize the nations was truly equivalent to violent Islamic jihad, or whether he merely said this in order to appear balanced and self-critical.”</p>

Christianity has no doctrine mandating warfare against and the subjugation of unbelievers. Islam does. And he is supposed to be the head of the Catholic Church, the largest Christian body in the world. He should thus be defending Christianity, not indulging in politically correct and fallacious moral equivalence.</p>

He wants Europe to commit civilizational suicide.</p>
