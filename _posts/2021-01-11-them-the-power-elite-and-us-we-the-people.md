<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Watching the utter hypocrisy and moral bankruptcy that is coming out of the fake news media, I had to jot down a few thoughts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>President Donald J Trump is my favorite President and I will not fade away into nothingness while they try to destroy him and everything that he has accomplished for our great Nation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>75 million Americans will not be canceled or shamed into silence for loving America, putting America first and trying to Make America Great Again!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am just as much of a Trump supporter today (January 11th 2021) as I was when I saw him come down the escalator to announce his candidacy at Trump tower.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hypocrites, the power elite and the street thugs do not intimidate me - they motivate me, vindicate my beliefs and make want to fight harder than ever for the land that I love.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The list of accomplishments of our great President are massive but one of them is that he exposed the corrupt Washington and media establishments and things will never go back to the way they were before him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Joe Biden is a a feeble old crook with dementia, he and the evil doers that surround him stole this election and he will never be my President.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am "We the People", I am a deplorable and I am a Trump supporter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We believe our rights come from God.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They believe that rooting out fraud is a threat to our democracy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We believe in freedom and liberty for all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They impose draconian and arbitrary lock downs on some but allow others to have more rights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We believe in border walls to protect our Nation and our families.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They are against border walls but live in gated communities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We believe in having the strongest and most powerful military in the world.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We love, respect and back our local police departments who protect and serve our communities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They want to defund the police but have private security for themselves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We stand for our flag with pride.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They want to erase our history.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They believe in raw power procured by any means necessary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We believe in freedom of speech, discussion, dialogue and critical thinking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We believe in putting the American worker first.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They outsource our jobs, in source cheap labor and offshore our companies but make sure their own families and friends are taken care of.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We judge people by the content of their character and not the color of their skin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They believe in grouping us and playing us against each other.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are the American people, we are Trump supporters and not only are we not going anywhere - we are advancing the line!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is 1776. Make America Great Again!</p>
