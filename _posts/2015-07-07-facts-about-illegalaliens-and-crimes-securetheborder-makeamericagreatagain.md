	</p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">According to a recent <a href="http://us4.campaign-archive1.com/?u=11002b90be7384b380b467605&amp;id=d18604d143&amp;e=76979bc5b2"><span style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">study</span></a> released from the Center for Immigration Studies, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released 30,558 criminally-convicted illegal immigrants, with a total of 79,059 convictions altogether, in 2014.
</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Furthermore, the CIS report shows that among the 904,000 illegal immigrants who have ignored orders to leave the U.S., approximately 167,527 of these are convicted criminal immigrants.
</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Likewise, CIS's April 2015 statistics indicate ICE has only arrested 11,983 at-large convicted criminal immigrantsâ€”despite the fact 168,000 criminal immigrants were identified.
</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">The concern is that these convicted criminal immigrants will commit crimes upon being released, as in Sanchez's case.
