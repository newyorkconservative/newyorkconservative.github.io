<p>There is a lot of commentary about yesterday so I just wanted to write a blurb on it from my experience:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What a day! We arrived before President Trump spoke. We all walked over to the Washington Monument and then down towards the Ellipse between the monument and the White House to hear him speak. It was amazing. Thousands of patriots from all over the Country – we ran into people from as far as Georgia, Colorado, North Carolina and even Alaska. Americans from all walks of life – marines, ferry boat captains, retired patriots, oath keepers etc. etc. It was a sea of peaceful and law abiding patriots. Thousands of patriots waving Gadsden Flags, Trump Flags, American Flags, Betsy Ross American flags and dozens of other types of patriotic flags.&nbsp; A day I will never forget.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Trump delivered a great speech. After Trump spoke we then marched over to the Capitol building. As we turned to walk across the National Mall I was shocked by the thousands upon thousands of patriots who were already on the steps of the Capital and the thousands making their way over. It was surreal. We stayed for probably over an hour, talked to some people, took some pictures and then finally headed back to our bus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the bus we heard the stories of what went on at the Capital. As is customary with the media everything was immediately laser focused on the controversy. As usual the media rushed to create a fake narrative about the “violent Trump supporters” without exploring any of the facts.</p>

<p>This morning I still don’t know all of the details but my understanding was one unarmed female Trump supporter was shot and killed and they are saying Antifa and other Marxist/Anarchists had infiltrated the protest and lead the way on the mayhem that took place in the Capital. They forced their way to the front of the crowd and broke into the building. Opinions and accusations are all over the internet but the facts will come out over the next few days.</p>

<p>This is a great observation from someone on Parler last night, “Leftists can riot all day, with no repercussions. Police are given stand down orders while thugs assault people, burn down buildings, smash store-fronts, terrorize entire cities – even attack police officers themselves – You can throw Molotov cocktails at them, throw rocks and bottles at them – Hell you can even take over police precincts and nothing will happen. But if we behave like them, even for a few minutes, the police are immediately ordered to respond and shoot us – Like the woman murdered by Capitol police earlier today.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I was there. Hundreds of thousands of good American patriots were there. They love their freedom and they wanted to stand up and speak out for &nbsp;fair and free elections and defend their Civil Liberties as they are entitled to under our First Amendment.</p>

<p>President Trump did not say anything that would incite violence or a riot. He merely talked about what happened. And given that fact that we have an obviously stolen and fraudulent presidential election on our hands - quite frankly - the American people have been extraordinarily restrained.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just imagine if the situation were reversed and Obama who received millions of votes less than Trump did had his second term flagrantly stolen from him?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There would be riots and violence from sea to shining sea and big tech and fake news would be all in on fueling and defending it.</p>
