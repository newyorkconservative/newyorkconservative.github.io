According to Babin, the administration should not be allowed to continue to expand the refugee resettlement program until the Government Accountability Office completes an audit of its costs. The Texas lawmaker introduced legislation to that end Wednesday.

“It is extremely unsettling that the Obama Administration would continue to expand the U.S. resettlement program at such an irresponsible pace in light of our economic and national security challenges,” Babin said Thursday.

Indeed refugees, unlike many other categories of immigrants are eligible for welfare. A recent annual report to Congress from the Office of Refugee Resettlement, for <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/04/01/3-in-4-refugees-on-food-stamps-many-using-other-forms-of-public-assistance/">example</a> found that three in four refugees were on food stamps.
