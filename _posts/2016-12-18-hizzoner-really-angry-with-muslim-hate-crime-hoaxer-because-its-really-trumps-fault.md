De Blasio is enraged that this girl has cast doubt on the flimsy and fictional Leftist narrative that Trump has led to a spike in hate crimes. He is not “really angry” with the girl’s parents for shaving her head and publicly humiliating her, and showing that she is in obvious danger for straying from Islamic norms. De Blasio can’t be angry about that: to do so would be “Islamophobic.”
