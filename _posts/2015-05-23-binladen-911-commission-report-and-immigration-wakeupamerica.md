	</p><p>"The 9/11 Commission Report" and the companion report, "9/11 and Terrorist Travel - Staff Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States," addressed a number of issues concerning how Al Qaeda was able to carry out attacks against the U.S., not just on September 11, 2001, but in a number of prior attacks.
</p><p>High on the list of root causes of the attacks were failures of the visa process and the immigration system, including concerns about border security and the inspections process conducted at ports of entry by employees of the former INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service).
</p><p>The failure of the immigration system to routinely apprehend illegal aliens was also identified as a serious vulnerability that terrorists have exploited and likely will continue to exploit.
</p><p>The adjudications process for immigration benefits also came under scrutiny, and the lack of integrity to the process enabling fraud to go undetected raised concerns such fraud had provided terrorists with the ability to embed themselves in communities around the U.S.
