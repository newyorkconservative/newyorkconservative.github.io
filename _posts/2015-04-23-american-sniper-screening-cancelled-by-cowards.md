	</p><p style="background: #f4f4f4"><span style="font-size:10pt">The University of Maryland announced it will postpone indefinitely an upcoming screening of "American Sniper" after Muslim students protested – calling the film Islamophobic, racist and nationalistic.
</span></p><p style="background: #f4f4f4"><span style="font-size:10pt">"American Sniper only perpetuates the spread of Islamophobia and is offensive to many Muslims around the world for good reason," <a href="https://www.change.org/p/muslim-students-association-see-pull-their-screening-of-american-sniper" target="_blank">read a petition launched by the university's Muslim Students Association. </a>"This movie dehumanizes Muslim individuals, promotes the idea of senseless mass murder, and portrays negative and inaccurate stereotypes."
