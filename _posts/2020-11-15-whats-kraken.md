<p>A couple of nights ago on Lou Dobbs’s show, President Trump's (and General Michael Flynn’s) lawyer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNQNw6ecRtc">Sidney Powell suggested</a> there was massive fraud in the&nbsp; presidential election vote tabulations.&nbsp;She said she&nbsp;was about to “release the Kraken.” Lin Wood, the other most prominent&nbsp;Trump election counsel, suggested much the same explosion of evidence establishing the presidential vote tabulations were manipulated.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was a&nbsp; bizarre switch on election eve. As&nbsp;vote counting suddenly and oddly was halted in several key states, the tallies, which had shown that a substantial victory was in the offing for the President, suddenly -- and statistically impossibly -- ran up huge numbers for Biden and away from Trump. This certainly creates an impression that the shift was the result of theft.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other indications besides the statements of these lawyers (the analyses by statisticians, the hundreds of sworn affidavits by poll watchers) who certainly would&nbsp; not risk their reputations on baseless charges of such significance, suggest that the counting was seriously flawed and likely tampered with.</p>

<p>By whom and how the evidence of it was obtained remains&nbsp;unclear, but as this is likely to be a continuing issue, I’d like to share what I have been able to find through the work of numerous online commenters and researchers .</p>

<p>While you may not agree that President Trump is a strategic genius who sees things far into the future and prepares for all contingencies, it cannot be doubted that two years ago he anticipated foreign interference with our election process and issued in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-imposing-certain-sanctions-event-foreign-interference-united-states-election/">an Executive Order</a> a means to investigate and punish any person, group or country which engaged in such international election fraud. </p>
