	</p><p>The speech that Trump made yesterday highlighted the real issues that we face in the U.S. today â€“ a Nation that is being ripped off by foreign competitors, American workers that are being sold out by their politicians at home, a Nation that is taking on the burden of unfettered wave after wave of illegal immigration and a Nation that has completely mismanaged and mishandled the Middle East.
</p><p>Trump spoke directly and with passion. He spoke with common sense and he highlighted real issues. 
</p><p>It was inspiring.
