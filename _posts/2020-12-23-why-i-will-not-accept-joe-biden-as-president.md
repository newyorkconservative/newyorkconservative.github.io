<p>When Twitter censors four of five Rush Limbaugh tweets in one day, I fear for the country.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When these monolithic Internet giants censor the president of the United States, I fear for the country.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I see elite billionaires like Mark Zuckerburg are able to spend $400 million to hire city governments to maximize turnout in specifically Democratic districts — without any regard to election spending laws or good governance standards — I fear for the country.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I read that Apple has a firm rule of never irritating China — and I watch the NBA kowtow to Beijing, I fear for our country.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I watch story after story about election fraud being spiked — without even the appearance of journalistic due diligence or curiosity — I know something is sick.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The election process itself was the final straw in creating the crisis of confidence which is accelerating and deepening for many millions of Americans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aside from a constant stream of allegations of outright fraud, there are some specific outrages — any one of which was likely enough to swing the entire election.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Officials in virtually every swing state broke their states’ own laws to send out millions of ballots or ballot applications to every registered voter. It was all clearly documented in the Texas lawsuit, which was declined by the U.S. Supreme Court based on Texas’ procedural standing — not the merits of the case. That’s the election.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, it’s clear that virtually every swing state essentially suspended normal requirements for verifying absentee ballots. Rejection rates were an order of magnitude lower than in a normal year. In Georgia, rejection rates dropped from 6.5% in 2016 to 0.2% in 2020. In Pennsylvania, it went from 1% in 2016 to .003% in 2020. Nevada fell from 1.6% to .75%. There is no plausible explanation other than that they were counting a huge number of ballots — disproportionately for Mr. Biden — that normally would not have passed muster. That’s the election.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The entire elite liberal media lied about the timeline of the COVID-19 vaccine. They blamed President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> for the global pandemic even as he did literally everything top scientists instructed. In multiple debates, the moderators outright stated that he was lying about the U.S. having a vaccine before the end of the year (note Vice President Mike Pence received it this week). If Americans had known the pandemic was almost over, that too was likely the difference in the election.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The unanimously never-<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> debate commission spiked the second debate at a critical time in order to hurt President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>. If there had been one more debate like the final one, it likely would have been pivotal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is just the beginning. But any one of those things alone is enough for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> supporters to think we have been robbed by a ruthless establishment — which is likely to only get more corrupt and aggressive if it gets away with these blatant acts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For more than four years, the entire establishment mobilized against the elected president of the United States as though they were an immune system trying to kill a virus. Now, they are telling us we are undermining democracy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You have more than 74 million voters who supported President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> despite everything — and given the election mess, the number could easily be significantly higher. The truth is tens of millions of Americans are deeply alienated and angry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Mr. Biden governs from the left — and he will almost certainly be forced to — that number will grow rapidly, and we will win a massive election in 2022.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given this environment, I have no interest in legitimizing the father of a son who Chinese Communist Party members boast about buying. Nor do I have any interest in pretending that the current result is legitimate or honorable. It is simply the final stroke of a four-year establishment-media power grab. It has been perpetrated by people who have broken the law, cheated the country of information, and smeared those of us who believe in America over China, history over revisionism, and the liberal ideal of free expression over cancel culture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I write this in genuine sorrow, because I think we are headed toward a serious, bitter struggle in America. This extraordinary, coordinated four-year power grab threatens the fabric of our country and the freedom of every American.</p>
