<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Google, Facebook and Twitter are all controlled by leftists that are undermining our Freedom of Speech, Censoring us and wielding way too much power in terms of controlling and steering the political discourse in our Country. Check out the Tucker Carlson show for the details. He has done a tremendous job in covering the "Tech Tyranny."<br></p>

<p>As a Conservative using Facebook and Twitter you are always being censored and operating with one hand tied behind your back.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On both of these platforms Islamic terrorists have more 1st Amendment rights than Christians or Conservative Americans.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are using Google you are being further manipulated.</p>

<p>One should check out the documentary "The Creepy Line" for more information on just how bad Google is.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have deplatformed from both Google and Chrome.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For search I have decided to go with DuckDuckGo https://duckduckgo.com/</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For my browser I have decided to go with Mozilla Firefox https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both DuckDuckGo and Firefox are committed to data privacy and have business models where the users personal information is not the end product.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Deplatforming takes about 15 minutes and the following link shows how to go from Chrome to Firefox.</p>
