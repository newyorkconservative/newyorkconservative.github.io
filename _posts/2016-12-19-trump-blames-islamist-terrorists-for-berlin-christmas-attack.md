President-elect Donald Trump released a statement that appears to blame “Islamist terrorists” for the attack on a Berlin Christmas market Monday.

“Innocent civilians were murdered in the streets as they prepared to celebrate the Christmas holiday,” said Trump. “ISIS and other Islamist terrorists continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad.”
