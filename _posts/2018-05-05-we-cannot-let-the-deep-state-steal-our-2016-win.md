Our Nation is better than what happened to President Donald Trump and his team during their transition into power.

God willing these corrupted institutions, starting at the very top, the Department of Justice and the FBI, will be reformed and restructured to "serve" NOT "sabotage" the will of the American people.

Both need to be drastically reduced in size and refocused with laser sharp precision to carry out their departments true objectives.

Americans voted Donald Trump into power and from day one their team was sabotaged by the deep state and a corrupted media.

But Donald Trump represents "we the people" - in effect the deep state, since Donald Trump has become President, has worked to overturn our votes.

The only purpose of the #MuellerWitchHunt is to overturn the 2016 election results.

The greatest threat to our Democracy does not come from the Russians, it comes from those Americans who have become so arrogant, corrupted and unfettered from morality that they believe they can impose their own wills "by any means necessary" on the rest of the Nation.
