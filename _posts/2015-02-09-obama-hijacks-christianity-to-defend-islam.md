	</p><p><span style="color:#333333;font-size:12pt">Since the President said that, "no god condones terror," I can only assume that he hasn't gone to the original source documents—the Qur'an. The Qur'an commands Muslims to "strike the heads" off the infidels (Sura 8:12); to "strike terror into the hearts of the enemies of Allah" (Sura 8:60); and to "slay the idolators wherever you find them" and to "prepare them for every ambush" (Sura 9:5). 
</span></p><p><span style="color:#333333;font-size:12pt">Sura 9:29 tells Muslims to "Fight those who do not believe in Allah… until they pay the tax in acknowledgment of superiority and they are in a state of subjection." (After all, the word "Islam" means "submission." If you don't submit and become a Muslim, you will die or pay a tax.) The next verse says, "May Allah destroy [the Christians and the Jews]." 
</span></p><p><span style="color:#333333;font-size:12pt">What if the "infidels" resist? Sura 5:33 prescribes the punishment: "The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land: that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter." These cheery tactics from "<a href="http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/"><span style="color:#0088cc;text-decoration:underline">the religion of peace</span></a>" find a home with ISIS and with a significant minority of Muslims today.
