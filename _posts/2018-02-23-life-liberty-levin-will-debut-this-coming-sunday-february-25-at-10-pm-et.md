<a id="auto-tag_fox-news-channel" href="http://deadline.com/tag/fox-news-channel/" data-tag="fox-news-channel">Fox News Channel</a> said today that its new Sunday show, <em><a id="auto-tag_life" href="http://deadline.com/tag/life/" data-tag="life">Life</a>, <a id="auto-tag_liberty-levin" href="http://deadline.com/tag/liberty-levin/" data-tag="liberty-levin">Liberty &amp; Levin</a>,</em> will debut this coming Sunday, February 25, at 10 PM ET. Which is a good thing because, <a href="http://deadline.com/2017/11/mark-levin-fox-news-channel-new-show-life-liberty-levin-1202213075/" rel="nofollow">back in November</a>, FNC promised that <a id="auto-tag_mark-levin" href="http://deadline.com/tag/mark-levin/" data-tag="mark-levin">Mark Levin</a>â€™s Sunday show would launch in February, and this coming Sunday is the last one in February.
