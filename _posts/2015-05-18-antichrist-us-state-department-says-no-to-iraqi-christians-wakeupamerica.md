	</p><p><span style="color:black; font-size:10pt">Kirsten Powers stated that President Barack Obama "just can't seem to find any passion for the mass persecution of Middle Eastern Christians or the eradication of Christianity from its birthplace."
</span></p><p><span style="color:black; font-size:10pt">The president's response appears to be United States policy. Evidence suggests that within the administration not only is there no passion for persecuted Christians under threat of genocide from the Islamic State, there is no room for them, period. In fact, despite ISIS' targeting of Iraqi Christians specifically because they are Christians, and, as such, stand in the way of a pure, Islamic Caliphate in the Middle East (and beyond), the U.S. State Department has made it clear that "there is no way that Christians will be supported because of their religious affiliation."
</span></p><p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color:black; font-size:10pt">On April 30, The Hudson Institute's Center for Religious Freedom director, Nina Shea, wrote about the State Department's refusing a non-immigrant visa to Iraqi Catholic nun. Sister Diana Momeka of the Dominican Sisters of St. Catherine of Siena was to come to Washington and testify about what ISIS is doing to Christians and other religious minorities (all the non-Christian members of the delegation were approved). She received a refusal letter saying, "You were not able to demonstrate that your intended activities in the United States would be consistent with the classification of the visa." And she was told at the U.S. consulate in Erbil that she was denied "because she was an IDP [Internally Displaced Person]." In other words, Sister Diana would use her non-immigrant visa to remain illegally in the United States. You know you can't trust those Brides of Christ to keep their word!
</span></p><p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color:black; font-size:10pt">In a follow up article on May 3, Shea revealed that the State Department requested that she revise her article. Shea refused, and wrote, concerning the State Department's actions:
</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color:black; font-size:10pt">Those who decided to block Sister Diana from entering this country on a visitor visa acted in a manner consistent with the administration's pattern of silence when it comes to the Christian profile of so many of the jihadists' "convert-or-die" victims in Syria, Libya, Nigeria, Kenya and Iraq. In typical U.S. condolence statements, targeted Christians have been identified simply as "lives lost," "Egyptian citizens," "Kenyan people," "innocent victims," or "innocent Iraqis."
