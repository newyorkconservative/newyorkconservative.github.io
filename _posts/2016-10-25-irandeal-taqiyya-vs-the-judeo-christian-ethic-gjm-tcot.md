	</p><p><span style="font-size:12pt">Unlike Judaism and Christianity which share an unambiguous commitment to honesty, as the saying goes, "honesty is the best policy," something we all are taught as a fundamental human value, Islam has a concept of Tiqiyya â€“ saying something that isn't true in certain circumstances based primarily upon a verse in the Koran, 3:28 prohibits Muslims to befriend non-Muslims over Muslims unless it is needed to protect themselves which includes the promulgation of Islam. "

And whoever does this has no connection with Allah except that you guard yourselves against them guarding carefully. And Allah cautions you against his retribution. And to Allah is the eventual coming."
