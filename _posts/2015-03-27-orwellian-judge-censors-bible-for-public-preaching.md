	</p><p style="background: white"><span style="color:#333333">In a highly unusual judgment, Michael Overd, who regularly preaches on the streets of Taunton, was told by the Judge that he should not have referred to Leviticus chapter 20 to make his point but clearly indicated that he could have used chapter 18 of the book. District Judge Shamim Ahmed Qureshi found that Mr Overd could have pointed to Leviticus 18:22 which describes homosexual practice as an 'abomination' but that reference to Leviticus 20:13 was inappropriate because the chapter refers to the death penalty. Mr Overd points out that in his use of Leviticus 20 he never referred to the death penalty. <em>"I am being punished for words that never passed my lips,"</em> he commented.
