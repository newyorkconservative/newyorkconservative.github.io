	</p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">A London black-cab driver has become the first person to be convicted in a British court for taking part in the Iraqi insurgency after a jury found him guilty of making bombs to kill US soldiers.
</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Anis Abid Sardar, 38, from Wembley, built improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Syria, which were planted on a road running west of Baghdad throughout 2007. Sardar was convicted of murder and conspiracy to murder at London's Woolwich crown court.
</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">One of the bombs caused the death of 34-year-old Sgt First Class Randy Johnson, of 2nd Stryker cavalry regiment, when it hit the armoured vehicle he was travelling in on 27 September 2007.
