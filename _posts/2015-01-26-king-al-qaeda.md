	</p><p>King Salman, Saudi Arabia's newly crowned monarch, has a controversial history of helping to fund radical terror groups and has maintained ties with several anti-Semitic Muslim clerics known for advocating radical positions, according to reports and regional experts.
</p><p>In 2001, an international raid of the Saudi High Commission for Aid to Bosnia, which Salman founded in 1993, unearthed evidence of terrorist plots against America, according to separate exposés written by <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=jT1xbK2EGRcC&amp;pg=PP3&amp;dq=hatred%27s+kingdom&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AMrCVOeKLoaRyQTwp4GIBw&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ" target="_blank">Dore Gold</a>, an Israeli diplomat, and <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Bo1n6uJEOPkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=robert+baer+saudi+crude&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8M_CVPX0DM6uyATvjICgCA&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA" target="_blank">Robert Baer</a>, a former CIA officer.
</p><p>
 </p><p>Salman is <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Bo1n6uJEOPkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=robert+baer+saudi+crude&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8M_CVPX0DM6uyATvjICgCA&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA" target="_blank">further accused</a> by Baer of having "personally approved all important appointments and spending" at the International Islamic Relief Organization (IIRO), a controversial Saudi charity that was hit with sanctions following the attacks of September 11, 2001, for purportedly providing material support to al Qaeda.
</p><p>
 </p><p>Salman also has been reported to be responsible for sending millions of dollars to the radical mujahedeen that waged jihad in Afghanistan in the 1980s, <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/markaz/posts/2015/01/22-saudi-abdullah-death-crown-prince-salman-successor" target="_blank">according</a> to Bruce Riedel, a former CIA officer who is now director of the Brookings Intelligence Project.
