	</p><p style="background: white"><span style="color:#333333;font-size:12pt">Today, for the second time in two years, <a href="http://www.becketfund.org/littlesisters/"><span style="text-decoration:underline">the Little Sisters of the Poor</span></a> must ask the Supreme Court to protect them from the government. The order of Catholic nuns and other non-profits have been forced to <a href="http://www.becketfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2015-07-23-LSP-RSI-Petition_Final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">ask the Court for relief</span></a> due to the government's refusal to exempt them from a regulation that makes them choose between their faith—which prohibits them from providing contraceptives—and continuing to pursue their religious mission of serving the elderly poor <em>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO-I3o0WjqU"><span style="text-decoration:underline">see video</span></a></em>).
</span></p><p style="background: white"><span style="color:#333333;font-size:12pt">"The government has lost every single time they have made these arguments before the Supreme Court—including last year's landmark Hobby Lobby case. One would think they would get the message and stop pressuring the Sisters," <strong>said Mark Rienzi, Senior Counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty and lead attorney for the Little Sisters of the Poor</strong>. "The government is willing to exempt big companies like Exxon, Chevron, and Pepsi Bottling, but it won't leave the Little Sisters alone."
