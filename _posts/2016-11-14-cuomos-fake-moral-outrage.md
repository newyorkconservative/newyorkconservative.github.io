On <a href="http://www.silive.com/">www.silive.com</a> this morning a headline said, “Governor Cuomo vows to protect minorities, immigrants after Trump win.”

The implication here is that a Trump win is somehow going to be troublesome for immigrants or minorities. Or that a program will be implemented to attack immigrants or minorities.

Throughout Trumps campaign Trumps policies on immigration can be summarized in two points:

First: <em>Lawful immigration – we will enforce our immigration laws and secure our borders</em>

Second: S<em>top immigration from places that export Islamic terrorism</em>

Trump also discussed shutting down the refugee resettlement programs from the war torn Middle East. These resettlement programs have already been infiltrated by ISIS militants that have committed terrorist atrocities across Europe <em>(France and Belgium)</em> and in the United States killing hundreds of innocent people.

Trumps policies and positions are not racist – they are common sense.

When Trump speaks about “illegal immigration” the MSM continues to report that Trump is speaking about “immigration.” The MSM refuses to truthfully print or state what Trump actually says. The media implies that “immigration” and “illegal immigration” are the same thing - they are not. We must reject the idea that someone is racist if they want to enforce the law. You are not racist or narrow minded if you don’t want terrorism in your Country.

Cuomo’s inflammatory rhetoric, attacking Bogeymen that do not exist, is stoking the very flames of racial animosity and tension that he claims to be against.
