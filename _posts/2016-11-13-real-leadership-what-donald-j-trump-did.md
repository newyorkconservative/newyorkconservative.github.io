On November 8<sup>th</sup> we witnessed the greatest political victory in American history. Donald J Trump is a special person and did the spectacular.

He defeated a corrupt, tired and desperate Democrat establishment, a timid and cowardly GOP, that was too afraid of his bluntness to back him, a despicable, corrupt and shameful media, a godless and pathetic Hollywood establishment and last but absolutely not least – the big three – what I call the “Ministry of Truth”: Google, Twitter and Facebook.

There has never been a victory like this in the history of our Republic. By going directly to the American people and calling the bull crap, we the people have been calling for years, Donald J Trump pulled out a victory and because of that is now - President Elect Donald J Trump.

His platform was a simple Common Sense Conservative platform. Donald J Trump called out the corrupt, broken and lawless immigration system, our insecure and open borders, the open attacks on our traditions, the thought police also known as political correctness, the all-out assault on our police and local law enforcement, and perhaps if not the main driver – the United States participation in a global economy that continues to recklessly move wealth and industry overseas.

He named our mortal enemy Islamic terrorism. He talked about getting rid of Obamacare - which we all now know is the “unaffordable health care act.” He spoke about putting Americans first. He talked up America. He talked about making America great again.

Millions of Americans see where the global elites want to take us. Millions of Americans have seen where Obama has taken us. Today our policies from economic, domestic to foreign are confusing and directionless.

Millions of Americans have spoken – and now Donald J Trump is the President Elect. My hope for the future has been restored. God Bless America.
