	</p><p>In his seventh year of "fundamentally transforming the United States of America," as Barack Obama memorably promised five days before he was elected president, we're learning new details about thousands of immigrants who were released from custody after being convicted of serious, violent felonies and horrific sex crimes. Instead of doing his duty to keep bad people out of America (or remove them if they manage to sneak in), Obama is bringing us even more diversity by accepting thousands of refugees from terrorist-harboring countries such as Syria and Somalia.
</p><p>Immigrants who commit a major crime inside the U.S. are supposed to be returned to their home country after completing their prison sentence. But a number of countries are refusing to take back their own criminals, so ICE just turns them loose in U.S. communities, freeing them to return to their criminal lifestyle.
</p><p>We have a U.S. law that is supposed to deal with this; it requires our State Department to impose visa sanctions on countries that refuse to take back their own citizens. But Obama's State Department simply ignores this law; that's called executive discretion.
