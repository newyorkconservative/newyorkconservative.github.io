	</p><p><span style="color:black; font-size:12pt">Saudi Arabia recently preached to the international community about the need to confront "intolerance, extremism and human rights violations."
</span></p><p><span style="color:black; font-size:12pt">If this sounds surreal, consider the following excerpts from a July 26 report in the <a href="http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentid=20150726251504"><span style="color:#631312; text-decoration:underline"><strong><em>Saudi Gazette</em></strong></span></a> (emphasis added):
</span></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="color:black; font-size:12pt">Saudi Arabia has reiterated its call on the international community to criminalize any act vilifying religious beliefs and symbols of faith as well as all kinds of discrimination based on religion.
</span></p><p><span style="color:black; font-size:12pt">Saudi Arabia wants Western cartoonists, comedians, and others—people who represent only their individual selves—to stop mocking the religious beliefs and symbols of Islam, even as the Arabian kingdom's own <em>institutionalized policy</em> is to vilify and discriminate against the religious beliefs and symbols of all other faiths.
</span></p><p><span style="color:black; font-size:12pt">Not a single non-Muslim worship building is allowed there; the highest Islamic authority decreed that it is "<a href="http://www.raymondibrahim.com/11358/saudi-mufti-destroy-churches"><span style="color:#631312; text-decoration:underline"><strong>necessary to destroy all the churches of the region</strong></span></a>."  Whenever Christians are suspected of meeting in a house for worship—or as one Saudi official once complained, "<a href="http://english.al-akhbar.com/content/saudi-detains-dozens-plotting-celebrate-christmas"><span style="color:#631312; text-decoration:underline"><strong>plotting to celebrate Christmas</strong></span></a>"—they are <a href="http://barnabasfund.org/US/News/Archives/Christians-detained-by-Saudi-religious-police-in-raid-on-private-home.html"><span style="color:#631312; text-decoration:underline"><strong>arrested and punished</strong></span></a>.
</span></p><p><span style="color:black; font-size:12pt">Any cross or other non-Muslim symbol found is confiscated and destroyed. Anyone caught trying to smuggle Bibles or any other "<a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/saudi-arabias-new-law-imposes-death-sentence-for-bible-smugglers-131352/"><span style="color:#631312; text-decoration:underline"><strong>publications that have prejudice to any other religious belief other than Islam</strong></span></a>" can be executed.
