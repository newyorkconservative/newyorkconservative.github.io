	</p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Police Commissioner Bill Bratton finally gave a figure for the number of new officers he wants added to the NYPD, requesting at least 450 new police Sunday to combat what he said was an increased threat from terrorist groups like ISIS.
</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Bratton said he hoped to get approval for the additional officers, a number that would be a compromise between the City Council and Mayor de Blasio and "very, very quickly."
</span></p><p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">"I'm going to put another 450 police officers â€“ if we get the approval...into our counterterrorism operations to increase the ability of our officers to protect critical sites around the city," Bratton said on grocery mogul John Catsimatidis's Sunday radio show on AM 970.
