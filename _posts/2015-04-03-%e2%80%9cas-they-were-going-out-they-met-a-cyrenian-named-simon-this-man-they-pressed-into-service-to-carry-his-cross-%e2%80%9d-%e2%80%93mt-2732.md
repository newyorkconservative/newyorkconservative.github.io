<p>After they had crucified him, they divided his garments by casting lots; then they sat down and kept watch over him there. And they placed over his head the written charge against him: This is Jesus, the King of the Jews. <p>Two revolutionaries were crucified with him, one on his right and the other on his left. Those passing by reviled him, shaking their heads and saying, "You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself, if you are the Son of God, [and] come down from the cross!" Likewise the chief priests with the scribes and elders mocked him and said, "He saved others; he cannot save himself. So he is the king of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now if he wants him. For he said, 'I am the Son of God.'" The revolutionaries who were crucified with him also kept abusing him in the same way.

<p style="text-align: center; background: white; margin-left: 18pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;"><p>From noon onward darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. <p>And about three o'clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "<i>Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?</i>"<p> which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" Some of the bystanders who heard it said, "This one is calling for Elijah." Immediately one of them ran to get a sponge; he soaked it in wine, and putting it on a reed, gave it to him to drink.<a name="48027049"></a>
<span style="color: #333333;">But the rest said, "Wait, let us see if Elijah comes to save him." <span style="color: black;">But Jesus cried out again in a loud voice, and gave up his spirit. And behold, the veil of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth quaked, rocks were split, tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised. <span style="color: #333333;"><a name="48027053"></a>And coming forth from their tombs after his resurrection, they entered the holy city and appeared to many. <span style="color: black;">The centurion and the men with him who were keeping watch over Jesus feared greatly when they saw the earthquake and all that was happening, and they said, "Truly, this was the Son of God!" <a name="48027055"></a>T<span style="color: #333333;">here were many women there, looking on from a distance,<span style="color: black;"> who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him. Among them were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee." Mt 27:33-56
