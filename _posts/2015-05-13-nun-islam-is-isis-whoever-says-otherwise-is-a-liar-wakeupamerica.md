She's listened to survivors tell how Christians and Yazidi women are being sold into sex slavery.<br/>"They choose the most beautiful one, even if they have a small child, and they sell these women, these ladies to each other. They don't sell to another religion -- only Sunni Muslim," Dogan said. "There have been 12,000 kidnapped at the hands of ISIS - Yazidi alone. What is going on there, what I was hearing, is the highest barbarism on earth in the history until today," she added.

And Islam is not peace, please. Whoever says ISIS has no connection to Islam or something like this is, he's a liar. ISIS is Islam; Islam is ISIS," Dogan explained.

And I hope America will understand. America today has the power that they can stop this disaster on the earth, with other Western countries," she argued.
