With the exception of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, all other candidates have made securing the U.S.-Mexican border a priority. While the U.S.-Mexican border <em>must</em> be made secure, the goal of securing that border is as deceptive as are the claims of the administration that the borders have never been more secure.

Purely focusing on the U.S.-Mexican border ignores the fact that, as I have noted in many articles and testimony at congressional hearings, the United States is a nation of 50 “border states.”
