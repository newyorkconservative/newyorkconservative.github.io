	</p><p><strong>If Islam is a religion of peace, what sort of peace does it bring?
</strong></p><p>Other understandings of Islam's record, though not its mission, within Islam may be also plausible, but no more so than this jihadist interpretation. It may be possible for some to read Islam as a religion of "peace." But its "peace," in its own terms, means the peace of Allah within its boundaries. With the rest of the outside world, it is at war in order to accomplish a religious purpose, namely, to have all submitted to Allah in the passive way that the Qur'an specifies.
