The states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, Michigan, and Arizona, all had changes made to their election laws that violated the federal Constitution. These states represent 73 electoral college votes. Itâ€™s a travesty that the Supreme Court has abdicated its duty to uphold the Constitution." -Mark Levin #TrumpWon #FightBack #StopTheSteal</figcaption></figure>
