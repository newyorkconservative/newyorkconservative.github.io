A Queens public high school principal excluded 500 Catholic school kids from a list of 4,000 students applying to get into his school, raising cries from furious parents of foul play.

Principal Khurshid Abdul-Mutakabbir told parents at a Juniper Park Civic Association meeting on March 16 he made a “clerical error” in omitting all Catholic school kids from the list.

But Abdul-Mutakabbir told civic leaders in a prior phone call that parochial applicants pose a “problem,” Juniper Hill president Bob Holden told The Post.

“He said, ‘In all honesty parochial schools are a problem because many of the students opt out and don’t go to my school. That leaves a seat [empty] and it costs the school funding,’” said Holden, who called for an investigation.

After parents got wind of the omissions and complained, DOE officials entered 207 parochial school applicants who had attended an open house or information session into a second lottery. On Tuesday, it offered seats to 66 of them — 15 percent of the accepted freshmen.

“All students who should have received an offer have received one,” said DOE spokesman Michael Aciman.

But double rejections left some Queens families distraught.
