	</p><p>A new Church policy toward Islam should be geared toward reversing that situation—that is, undercutting Islam's faith in itself while at the same time strengthening the faith of Christians…..There are numerous indications that Catholic authorities are badly informed about Islam—else why do they continue to maintain, in the face of overwhelming evidence, that Islam is a religion of peace? So the first thing that Catholics need to do is to get up to speed on Islam.
