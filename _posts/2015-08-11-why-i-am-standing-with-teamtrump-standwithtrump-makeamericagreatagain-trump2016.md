	</p><p>Why I am standing with Trump – it's very simple:
</p><ol><li><span style="text-decoration:underline">America First Mindset:</span> "I love America. And when you love something, you protect it passionately – even fiercely." – Trump – "Time to Get Tough" pg7
</li><li><span style="text-decoration:underline">His ideas:</span> He has simple but great "common sense" ideas that will improve the lives of all Americans. He has articulated a bunch of them over the last few years and "Time to Get Tough" which I just read - is full of good ideas. He has the right mindset. He knows what is wrong with our Country and wants to fix it.
</li><li><span style="text-decoration:underline">Trump Brand – Confident, Aggressive and Winning:</span> Trump is a confident, aggressive winner and a killer <em>(in the business sense)</em> that will be able to get the job done. If someone in that field can build that wall on our Southern border or give us pro-American trade deals that give America the upper hand, it is Donald Trump. He is an aggressive winner and will surround himself with winners who will deliver.
</li><li><div><span style="text-decoration:underline">The Status Quo needs to be turned on its head:</span> The Grand Old Party does not even understand what is going on with this Country and much less are they willing to do anything about it. Trump has the understanding and the sense of urgency around what is happening and turning it around. He say's repeatedly – "We are running out of time." He is right.
</div><p>2 simple examples –
</p><ol><li>During 9/11 W Bush with a GOP controlled congress did not secure the border. The current GOP cannot be trusted to enforce our immigration laws and cannot be taken seriously when it comes to immigration and law enforcement.
</li><li>In today's economy there is no way in hell we should be issuing 1 million green cards a year. It's a disaster for the American worker. Trump will put a halt on that immediately.
</li></ol></li></ol><p>I am a life-long conservative. To me it doesn't matter what Trumps positions were 10-15 years ago – right here and right now - who is the guy that is best positioned to derail us from going over the cliff and make America great again?
</p><p>I have had enough of the failed status quo - I am going to take my chances with Donald Trump.</p>
