Even if there were no terrorists among the migrants flooding into Europe from Muslim lands, there would still be plenty to worry about. A large percentage of these migrants come from sharia cultures, and they carry the sharia ethos with them. That means that many of them will harbor very strong anti-Semitic and anti-Christian sentiments, a low opinion of women, and other attitudes that spell trouble for non-sharia-compliant infidels.
