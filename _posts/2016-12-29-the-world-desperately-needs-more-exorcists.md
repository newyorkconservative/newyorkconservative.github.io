The situation is dire, he said, because rampant pornography, illegal narcotic use and the occult have made it easier for Satan to cast his net.

“Exorcism is like triage. We’re the emergency crew — but there aren’t enough of us,” Lampert told The Post.

Lampert cautioned that while prayers initially may keep demons at bay, long-term treatment is needed.

“In praying with them, we give them a sense of hope and knowing that they’re not alone — but they have to do the work, too.

“It’s about reintegrating people into a life of faith. If they don’t want skin in the game, they don’t want to pray or follow up, then we can’t help them.”
