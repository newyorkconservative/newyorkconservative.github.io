You can look at American history from two perspectives.

The first is that America is a good place, a beautiful idea and a force for greatness. You can look at American history as a patriot who loves their Nation.

America has a history that is filled with patriots who gave their very lives to secure our freedoms and liberty - from 1776 to 2017 - inventors and explorers who flourished in a free new world that made brilliant and profound discoveries and finally the brilliant statesmen, also known as our Founding Fathers, who put together the greatest system of Government ever known to man - and the oldest Constitutional Republic in existence.

I am a proud American with nothing but gratitude for the sacrifices of those who have come before me - from my family to my fellow patriots.

But you can also look at American history with resentment and contempt.

It us utter foolishness to believe that taking down statues and physically attacking monuments, that have stood for generations with very deep historical meaning, will do any real good and nothing other than provoke resentment leading to less peace and more animosity.

But the political attacks on memorials are merely manifestations of an attitude and viewpoint.

Because life itself is approached the same way - and politics is just an extension of it - you can have an attitude of gratitude or a mind filled with resentment.

But you cannot have both - as a proud American I will always choose gratitude.
