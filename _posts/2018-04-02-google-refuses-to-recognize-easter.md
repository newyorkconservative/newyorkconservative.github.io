<p class="unnamed10" align="left">Google has refused to recognize Easter by failing to devote a “doodle” to the Christian holiday despite commemorating numerous other obscure events and people, leading actor James Woods to remark, “they loathe Christians”.</p>
<p class="unnamed10" align="left">According to Wikipedia, “A Google Doodle is a special, temporary alteration of the logo on Google’s homepages that commemorates holidays, events, achievements, and people.”</p>
<p class="unnamed10" align="left">Google has previously <a href="https://www.frontpagemag.com/point/262919/google-honors-communist-traitor-and-al-qaeda-daniel-greenfield">devoted</a> a doodle to Yuri Kochiyama, a Communist activist who once said she admired Osama Bin Laden, to recognize her would-be 95th birthday.</p>
