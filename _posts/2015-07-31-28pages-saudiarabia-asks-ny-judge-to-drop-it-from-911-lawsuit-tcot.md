	</p><p>Saudi Arabia had nothing to do with the Sept. 11 attacks and should be dismissed as a defendant in lawsuits brought by victims' families, a lawyer for the kingdom told a judge Thursday.
</p><p>Attorney Michael Kellogg made the argument before a Manhattan federal judge, who did not immediately rule.
</p><p>Saudi Arabia was dropped as a defendant nine years ago by a judge who said it was protected by sovereign immunity, but a federal appeals court in December 2013 reinstated it, saying a legal exception existed and the circumstances were extraordinary.
</p><p>Kellogg said there were no facts showing Saudi Arabia knew of the attacks in advance or knowingly aided terrorists.
