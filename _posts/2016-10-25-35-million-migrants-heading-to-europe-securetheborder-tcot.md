<p class="p1">The huge figure was revealed today by Hungary's minister for foreign affairs and trade Peter Szijj치rt칩.</p>
<p class="p1">Speaking as the country begins <a id="itxthook1" class="itxtnewhook itxthook" href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/606211/35-MILLION-migrants-Europe-Hungary-builds-second-fence#" rel="nofollow"><span id="itxthook1w" class="itxtrst itxtrstspan itxtnowrap itxtnewhookspan">work</span></a> on its second fence to stop migrants heading across its border he predicted the current crisis will continue for years.</p>
<p class="p1">Mr Szijj치rt칩 told Hungarian Times: "The name of the fence is 'Temporary <a id="itxthook2" class="itxtnewhook itxthook" href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/606211/35-MILLION-migrants-Europe-Hungary-builds-second-fence#" rel="nofollow"><span id="itxthook2w" class="itxtrst itxtrstspan itxtnowrap itxtnewhookspan">Security</span></a> Border Fence' but I think there is no question that in this case temporary means years.</p>
<p class="p1">"It's a self delusion to call this situation a migration crisis; it is a massive migration of nations, with inexhaustible reserves.</p>
<p class="p1">"I don't think that the <a id="itxthook3" class="itxtnewhook itxthook" href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/606211/35-MILLION-migrants-Europe-Hungary-builds-second-fence#" rel="nofollow"><span id="itxthook3w" class="itxtrst itxtrstspan itxtnowrap itxtnewhookspan">analysis</span></a> results, stating that 30-35 million people out there could possibly become migrants, would be an exaggeration.</p>
