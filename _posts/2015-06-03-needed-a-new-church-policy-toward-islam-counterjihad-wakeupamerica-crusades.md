	</p><p><span style="font-size:10pt">"Ideas disconnected from realities" is a good way to describe the Church's Islam policy. That policy does not seem to have done much to prevent persecution of Christians in Muslim lands. How about Catholics who do not live in the danger zones? Catholics who live in the West and rely on the Church for their understanding of Islam can be forgiven if they still remain complacent about the Islamic threat. That's because there is absolutely nothing in recent official Church statements that would lead them to think that there is anything to worry about. <em>Lumen Gentium</em>? <em>Nostra Aetate</em>? <em>The Catechism of the Catholic Church</em>? <em>Evangelii Gaudium</em>? All discuss Islam, but not in a way that would raise the slightest concern. The Catholic who wonders what to think about Islamic terrorism and then consults his <em>Catechism</em> only to find that "together with us they adore the one, merciful God" will likely conclude that terrorists are distorting and misinterpreting their religion. Confident that the Church has spoken definitively on the matter, he'll roll over and go back to sleep.
