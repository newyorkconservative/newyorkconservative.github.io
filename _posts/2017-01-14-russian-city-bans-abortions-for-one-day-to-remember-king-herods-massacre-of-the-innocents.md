The church described January 11, 2017 as a “day of silence without abortions,” <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-38583663">BBC News</a> stated.

“On this day, all public health institutions of the Yaroslavl Region are prohibited to perform abortions,” the Archdiocese of Yaroslavl told RT News. “Certain events have been scheduled aimed at combating the murder of babies in the womb and protecting the priceless value of motherhood.”

The “Massacre of the Innocents” refers to King Herod’s planned execution of young boys under the age of 2 living in proximity to Bethlehem around the time of Jesus’ birth, according to the Second Chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the Bible. Herod ordered the mass-slaughter of infants because he feared losing his coveted throne to the newborn King of the Jews, based on news delivered to him by the Magi.

The Yaroslavl diocese simultaneously plans a “Candle of Memory” event to commemorate the children whose lives ended not only under the reign of King Herod, but also due to abortion, RT News stated.
