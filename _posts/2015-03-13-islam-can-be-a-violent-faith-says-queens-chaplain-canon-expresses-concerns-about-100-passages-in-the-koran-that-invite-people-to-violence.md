	</p><p style="background: white"><span style="color:black; font-size:12pt">Presenter Iain Dale said Muslims would say Islam was 'entirely peaceful', but Rev Ashenden said parts of the Koran 'tell you to kill your enemies'. He then quoted verses which he said urged Muslims to 'strike off the heads' of 'those who disbelieve'. When warned his comments could offend Muslims, he said: 'If they are offended by my quoting the Koran they are not offended by me, they are offended by the Koran.' He added: 'If you're going to talk about excitement in Christianity it's about delivering people from evil and transforming people's lives.' Asked whether he would describe certain parts of the Koran as evil, he said: 'I notice that they invite people to violence. I'll let other people decide whether that's good or evil.'
