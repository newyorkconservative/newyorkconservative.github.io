	</p><p><span style="color:black;font-family:Arial;font-size:9pt">"Mary Magdalene stayed outside the tomb weeping.<br />And as she wept, she bent over into the tomb<br />and saw two angels in white sitting there,<br />one at the head and one at the feet<br />where the Body of Jesus had been.<br />And they said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?"<br />She said to them, "They have taken my Lord,<br />and I don't know where they laid him."<br />When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus there,<br />but did not know it was Jesus.<br />Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?<br />Whom are you looking for?"<br />She thought it was the gardener and said to him,<br />"Sir, if you carried him away,<br />tell me where you laid him,<br />and I will take him."<br />Jesus said to her, "Mary!"<br />She turned and said to him in Hebrew, "Rabbouni," <br />which means Teacher.<br />Jesus said to her, "Stop holding on to me,<br />for I have not yet ascended to the Father.<br />But go to my brothers and tell them,<br />'I am going to my Father and your Father,<br />to my God and your God.'"<br />Mary went and announced to the disciples,<br />"I have seen the Lord,"<br />and then reported what he had told her." â€“ John 20:11-18</span></p>
