<p>Here is a list of things that i have experienced on twitter - who knows what other things are being done that I have not experienced but are happening -</p>
<p>1. Twitter automatically unfollowed conservatives that I was following, it most likely did the same to those who were following me</p>
<p>2. Twitter limited some of my account features, see the picture above, because of the following tweet -</p>
<p>"In a free society with a Bill of Rights tolerance has to be a two way street to work – there is no reason someone should be intimidated for getting something to eat at <a class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/ChickfilA" data-mentioned-user-id="16043308"><s>@</s><b>ChickfilA</b></a> – if you like the food go for it – this is America – no apologies are required – freedom baby! <a class="twitter-hashtag pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MAGA?src=hash" data-query-source="hashtag_click"><s>#</s><b>MAGA</b></a>“,</p>
<p>if you notice the below caption, in that above graphic, they say that Google may capture certain aspects of me and my phone and <strong><em>also use them</em></strong>, which is obviously another privacy violation. I never signed up for any Google service by using twitter and Google has a terrible track record when it comes to privacy.</p>
<p>3. Twitter did the same thing (2) after I posted numerous posts to #TheRussiaHoax hashtag and had me re-verify my account even though I had already done so. I noticed that after this my cell phone was listed in my account.</p>
<p>4. Twitter automatically set my cell phone in my account settings even though I deliberately deleted it out - this is a massive privacy violation because accounts get hacked from time to time and our cell phone # is almost as valuable as our social security number.</p>
<p>5. There were other privacy settings that were tweaked in my iPhone even though I know as a matter of fact I had set them to the most private settings. So now I periodically check my privacy settings.</p>
<p>6. Twitter periodically removes my pinned tweet - could be a bug but I doubt it.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;A friend setup a new twitter account - registering they wanted to use their email instead of their cell phone - after they configured their account they logged in and started following some popular conservatives - they were immediately flagged for unusual behavior and locked out - the unusual behavior that was exhibited was following popular conservatives - prior to that there were no issues with the account</p>
<p>8. On October 8th 2018, and the days after, it was widely reported by various conservatives, including myself, that people were losing a large amount of followers, there were some rumors that accounts were being purged of "bots" but that was definitely not the case - there is most likely no coincidence that this is happening only a few weeks before a critical mid-term election that could decide the fate of the Trump Presidency</p>
<p>9. On September 28th my twitter account was locked out - apparently someone decided to report me to #ReportTheBot - now I cannot use twitter without not only entering my cell phone but <em><strong>keeping it listed in my account</strong></em>. So as soon as I remove my cell phone my account is locked out and I have to re-verify and re-enter it.</p>
<p>So this is pretty amazing - someone is able to randomly report me and then twitter takes that info without any real validation and reduces my privacy capabilities.</p>
<p>I put in a report to twitter and I am awaiting their feedback - I wrote -</p>
<p>"Today when I was logging into twitter I found out that my twitter account had been locked out - apparently someone reported by account under the hashtag #ReportTheBot and now I cannot use twitter unless I keep my mobile phone in my profile.</p>
<p>So it is no longer to verify by having twitter send my cell phone a code, it literally will not let me use twitter unless the phone number stays there.</p>
<p>As a matter of privacy I do not want to do that. I am not a bot and have to continue proving that I am not a bot.</p>
<p>I want to be able to continue to use twitter but also would not want my cell phone listed.</p>
<p>Why is this now happening to my account?</p>
<p>Also I do not think it is fair that any user can do this to another user just because they do not like what the user is saying."</p>
<p>10. On January 31st 2020 my twitter account was suspended for the first time. I was using my account a good amount on the night of January 30th and I looked at my account the morning of January 31st.</p>
<p>When I checked my account around noon on January 31st I saw that I had no followers and was not following anyone.</p>
<p>I tried to retweet something and saw the following message -</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newyorkconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0157.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4841 aligncenter" src="https://www.newyorkconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0157-169x300.png" alt="" width="169" height="300"></a></p>
<p>On a major news day my account was suspended and for no reason. I received no warnings.</p>
<p>Nothing that I wrote violated the twitter terms and services -</p>
<p>https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules</p>
<p>I sent an email to twitter and they are looking into the situation.</p>
<p>I have to add that for any of the above mentioned times that my account was locked out there was never a reason the company provided.</p>
<p>Which is strange because if there was some tweet in particular or some behavior that I was engaging in that was causing the lock-outs, I would think the company would let me know so that I do not repeat it.</p>
<p>But all they do is send a link with their terms and conditions.</p>
<p>I would assume that it is specifically vague so that they can censor things they disagree with from a personal standpoint.</p>
<p>Twitter can talk all it wants to about the "conversation" but it is obvious that the company wants to be a left leaning content provider much more than it wants to be a forum for the information sharing of different and competing ideas.</p>
<p>I will update this thread when I hear more....</p>
