Dear Governor Phil Murphy,

In an era of rampant drug overdoses and drug abuse via prescription pills, fentanyl and heroin, the average voter of New Jersey, certainly anyone with children and a family; must find it stunning that the legalization of recreational marijuana could be a priority of the new Governor of New Jersey.

Legalizing “recreational marijuana” is an attack on the families of New Jersey and the families of the tri-State area, especially the states that border New Jersey - including my home state of New York. It is first and foremost an attack on young people and also the most vulnerable young people who turn to drugs as an easy way out of escaping their problems.

We live in a society today, where instead of our leaders encouraging good morality our leaders continue to negotiate downwards when it comes to “what is right or wrong” and “what is acceptable and not-acceptable.” Instead of standing firm in solid values and upholding sound morality it has become much easier to just lower the bar. Expecting less from young people means we are giving up on them.
<p style="text-align: center;">As a society we are giving up on young people.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">                 It is a contradiction to say you want to help the “most vulnerable” in your State and at the same time “legalize marijuana” for recreational use. Because legalizing this drug will not help anyone – it will normalize drug use and open the spigot for a new generation of drug addicts and drug abusers. Just like we have seen with the prescription drug pill industry – which is also legal - it will just make it easier for more drug abuse.</p>
                Look at the current state of affairs when it comes to drug usage and drug addiction – the use of fentanyl – the abuse of prescription drugs – the abuse of heroin. Young people are dying every single day. Open a local newspaper and there will be plenty of evidence of it.

And these same young people will most certainly tell you, if they could, that the first drug of choice for them was marijuana. Talk to drug addicts today – drug addicts living on the street. Drug addicts in rehabs – 99% of the time if it’s not through prescription pills which are also legal that lead to their demise, marijuana will be the other starting point.

Marijuana is and will always be a gateway drug into harder and more dangerous substances. Legalizing this drug in a heavily populated State like NJ will be a major disaster in the fight against drug abuse.

Of course I ask you to defer to prudence and reconsider this initiative, I also ask the good people of New Jersey to stand up for their families and their neighborhoods. Because this will be a disaster.
