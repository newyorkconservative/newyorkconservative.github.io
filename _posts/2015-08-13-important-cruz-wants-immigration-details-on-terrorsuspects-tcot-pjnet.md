"We write regarding the alarming increase in the number of individuals in the United States who have engaged in acts of terrorism or conspired to provide material support to foreign terrorist organizations over the last year," the two senators said in the letter.

Sessions's office added in a release that the letter "addresses the large number of persons inside the United States involved with [the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria] and other Islamic terror organizations whose presence in the United States results from immigration policy."

The two senators said they used publicly available information toÂ identify 72 people in the United States who during the past year "engaged in or attempted to engage in acts of terrorism; conspired or attempted to conspire to provide material support to a terrorist organization; engaged in criminal conduct inspired by terrorist ideology; or who have been sentenced for any of the foregoing."
