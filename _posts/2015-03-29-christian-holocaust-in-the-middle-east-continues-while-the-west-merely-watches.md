After the recent atrocities by ISIS, it says, "Christians have migrated from the region in increasing numbers, which is part of a longer-term exodus related to violence, persecution, and lack of economic opportunities stretching back decades."
</span></p><p><span style="color:black">These latest horrors build on the prejudice, discrimination and oppression that over the past few decades have steadily reduced the proportion of Christians in the Middle East from around 20 percent at the start of the 20th century to around 5 percent now. Less than 1 percent of the world's more than 2 billion Christians live in the Middle East, and there are fears that number could dwindle even further.
