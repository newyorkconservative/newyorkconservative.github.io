 </p><p><span style="color:#545454; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Obama's deputies are "lessening the vetting of each and every alien who applies for permanent residency or citizenship in the U.S.," Palinkas said in a statement Tuesday.

 </p><p><span style="color:#545454; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">"By not scrutinizing each and every applicant to the fullest extent possible to ensure America's security, we invite an even more catastrophic event than what occurred on 09/11/2001," he said.
