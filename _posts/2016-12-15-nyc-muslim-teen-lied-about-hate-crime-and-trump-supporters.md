The Muslim teen who <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/12/02/cops-hunt-for-trio-who-harassed-muslim-woman-on-train/">claimed three drunks taunted her as a “terrorist” </a>on a Manhattan subway train now admits she lied to cops — who arrested her on Wednesday.

Yasmin Seweid, 18, is charged with obstructing governmental administration and filing a false report, according to a high-ranking police source.

Both charges are misdemeanors punishable by up to a year in jail.

Seweid, who lives in Nassau County, had claimed the hateful drunks shouted, “Trump! Trump!” and called her a “terrorist” as they tried to steal her headscarf. “Go back to your country!” she said they shouted during the supposed Dec. 1 attack.
