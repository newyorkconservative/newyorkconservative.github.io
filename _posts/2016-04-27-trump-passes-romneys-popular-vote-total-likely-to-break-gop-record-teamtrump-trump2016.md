With his five blowout wins Tuesday night, Donald Trump has passed Mitt Romney’s popular vote total from four years ago and is on a trajectory that could land him more Republican votes than any presidential candidate in modern history – by a lot.

Trump surged to <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/republican_vote_count.html" target="_blank">9.9 million votes</a>, according to totals that include Tuesday’s preliminary results across the northeast and could rise further as the final votes are counted. That’s already more than 100,000 more than <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/republican_vote_count.html" target="_blank">Romney earned</a> in the entire 2012 primary season and tens of thousands more than <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/republican_vote_count.html" target="_blank">John McCain earned</a> in 2008.

Trump is certain to pass McCain’s total next week in Indiana, but more importantly, he’s positioned to easily pass the modern record-holder George W. Bush — <a href="http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2000/2000presprim.htm" target="_blank">who collected 10.8 million</a> votes in 2000.

That presents an uncomfortable reality for anti-Trump forces: they’re attempting to thwart the candidate who is likely to win more Republican primary votes than any GOP contender in at least the last 36 years, and maybe ever.
