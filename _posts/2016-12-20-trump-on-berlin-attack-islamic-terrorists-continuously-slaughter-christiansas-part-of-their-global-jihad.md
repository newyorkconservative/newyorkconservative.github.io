President-Elect Donald Trump has issued a statement after at least nine people were killed and 50 injured in a truck attack in Berlin, Germany….
<blockquote>Our hearts and prayers are with the loved ones of the victims of today’s horrifying terror attack in Berlin. Innocent civilians were murdered in the streets as they prepared to celebrate the Christmas holiday. ISIS and other Islamic terrorists continuously slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad. These terrorists and their regional and worldwide networks must be eradicated from the face of the earth, a mission we will carry out with all freedom-loving partners.</blockquote>
At the same time that this statement was released, Trump tweeted about the situation in Berlin in addition to the assassination of Russia’s ambassador to Turkey. Trump also mentions a shooting that occurred at a mosque in Switzerland that left three people wounded.
