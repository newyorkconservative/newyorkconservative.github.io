	</p><p>ICC Note: <em>As the conflict in Syria moves closer to its third year, attention is again being raised to the plight of the country's Christian community which has been left vulnerable in the midst of the conflict. Throughout the Middle East Christians have typically presented a moderating force, committed to non-violence, valuing diversity, and promoting peace-building and education. With the specific targeting of Christians and churches this appears to be lost as many have fled their homes and for some the region.</em>
