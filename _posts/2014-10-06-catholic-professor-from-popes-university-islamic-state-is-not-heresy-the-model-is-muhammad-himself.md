He states: 'You will find no arguments within Muslim theology that can be used to condemn Islamic State's behavior as un-Islamic.' ...<br /><br />Martin Rhonheimer then undergoes the suras in the Quran that prescribe what should happen to the conquered Christians and Jews, and points out that the Islamic State strictly adhere to these regulations. Islam would like to influence the state and society in details, emphasizes Rhonheimer. <br /><br />'Islam is more than a religion. It is cult with political and social rules and unites religion and and political and social order in one. And it has always been violent,' he says.
