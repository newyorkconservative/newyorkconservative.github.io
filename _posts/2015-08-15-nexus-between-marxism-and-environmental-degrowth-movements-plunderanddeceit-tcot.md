<span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Over forty-years ago, philosopher and author Ayn Rand, in her book Return of the Primitive</span>—<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">The Anti-Industrial Revo</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">lut</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">ion, wrote presciently that the statists had changed their line of attack. “Instead of their old promises that collectivism would create universal abundance and their denunciations of capitalism for creating poverty, they are now denouncing capitalism for creating abundance. Instead of promising comfort and security for everyone, they are now denouncing people for being comfortable and secure.”</span></span>

<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">She continued: “The demand to ‘restrict’ technology is the demand to restrict man’s mind.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It is nature—i.e., reality—that makes both these goals impossible to achieve. Technology can be destroyed, and the mind can be paralyzed, but neither can be restricted. Whether and wherever such restrictions are attempted, it is the mind—not the state—that withers away.”</span></span>

“<span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">To restrict technology would </span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">require omniscience—a total knowledge of all the possible effects and consequences of a given development for all the potential innovators of the future. Short of such omniscience, restrictions mean the attempt to regulate the unknown, to limit the unborn, to set rules for the undiscovered.”</span></span>

“<span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">A stagnant technology is the equivalent of a stagnant mind. A </span></span>‘<span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">restricted’ technology is the equivalent of a censored </span></span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">mind.”</span></span>
