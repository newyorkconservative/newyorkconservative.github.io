Yesterday the New York Post listed the five worst school shootings in US history:

1 – 2007 - Virginia Tech University <em>(32 people killed)</em>

2 - 2012 - Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown Connecticut - <em>(27 people killed)</em>

3 – 2018 - Wednesday February 14 - Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Florida <em>(17 people killed)</em>

4 – 1966 - University of Texas – <em>(13 people killed)</em>

5 – 1999 - Columbine Massacre – <em>(13 people killed)</em>

Of the five worst school shootings in US history 4 of them have happened since 1999 and the top three happened over the last 11 years. These evil massacres – overshadow some of the most historical bloodbaths in American history – and by a lot. Take the Boston Massacre of 1770 for example - 5 civilians died. In the infamous Valentine’s Day Massacre of 1929 - 7 people were killed.

The Daily News reported yesterday that in the <em><u>first 45 days of 2018 there have been 18 school shootings</u></em> across the United States alone.

When you factor in the Islamic terrorism we have seen over the last 20 years there is one conclusion that can be drawn – very evil and ultra-violent things are happening all around us. But why and what are some of the trends over the last 20 years we should be looking at?

The devil is making inroads through the void found in the destruction of the family, violent and aggressive secularism and technology.

Big Technology dehumanizes people and continues to blur reality with virtual reality – Facebook/Google/Twitter. Social media is a cesspool of narcissism and nihilism.

People have access to all sorts of vile imagery at their fingertips, on the internet, at any given moment in time – from graphic terrorist attacks to pornography – all of it violent, degrading and dehumanizing. Everything must bear its fruit – when you constantly fill your head with garbage it will eventually manifest itself.

Video games and virtual reality continue to advance in terms of how real they look and this has to have an impact on how some perceive actual reality. One headline about the Newtown shooter said that <em>“he</em><em> notched up 83,000 online kills including 22,000 'head shots' using violent games to train himself for his massacre”.</em>

Hollywood, while vocally anti Second Amendment – <em><u>“let’s get rid of all the guns”</u></em> - continues to peddle the most graphic and ultra-violent movies in its cinematic history. So rather than trying to get rid of the Second Amendment, which Hollywood will never do, it can and should look to clean up its own act.

Christianity and true Spirituality vs. Psych Meds and the quick fix – rather than cultivating a religious family life oriented in the principles of Jesus Christ and based on the 10 Commandments too many people today are more apt to look for a quick fix in a pill and medicate people with psych meds vs. taking the real responsibility of dealing with and solving the individuals underlying problems.

As is now happening far too often this creates the phenomenon of the ticking time bomb where when confronted in dealing with some regular life issue in a normal manner – the issue sets off one of these lunatics to act out the most heinous and diabolical things imaginable.

Patrick Buchanan bluntly states in his recent column <em>“</em><em>Nikolas Cruz was a product of broken families. He was adopted. Both adoptive parents had died. Where did he get his ideas of right and wrong, good and evil? Before the Death of God and repeal of the Ten Commandments, in those dark old days, the 1950s, atrocities common now were almost nonexistent.”</em>
