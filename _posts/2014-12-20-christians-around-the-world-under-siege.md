	</p><p>ICC Note: <em>The reality is that in far too many countries Christians face incredible risk simply for their faith. Some make the headlines, but much more "is unseen by the world" and the daily reality of persecution that Christians face. To meet together as Christians is a dangerous task, but a necessary one. As we meet this year in our religious celebrations we should pause to remember those who are celebrating the same truths, yet paying a much higher cost to do so.</em>
