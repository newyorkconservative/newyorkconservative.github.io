Father Maximilian Kolbe, who died today in 1941, was a Polish priest who died in Auschwitz. A theologian and teacher noted for his devotion to Mary, he undertook missionary work in China and Japan before returning to Poland because of ill-health before the war.

When war broke out he refused to take advantage of his mixed German-Polish parentage to claim German citizenship. His monastery at Niepokalan√≥w hid up to to 2,000 Jews from the Nazis and produced anti-Nazi publications and radio broadcasts.

Kolbe was arrested on February 17, 1941, and transferred to Auschwitz on May 28. He was subjected to beating and other ill-treatment. When three prisoners escaped, 10 others were selected to be starved to death in an underground bunker. When one of them cried out "My wife! My children!", Kolbe volunteered to take his place. He was the last left alive after two weeks of starvation and dehydration and was eventually killed by an injecton of carbolic acid. He is said to have raised his arm and waited calmly for the needle.
