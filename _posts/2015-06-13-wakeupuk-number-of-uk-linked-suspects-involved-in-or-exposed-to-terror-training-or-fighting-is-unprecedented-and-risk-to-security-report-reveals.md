	</p><p>There are more Britons trained in terrorism than at any point in the country's history in a growing threat to national security, MI5 has warned. The Security Service said the number of UK-linked suspects involved in or exposed to terror training or fighting with fanatics is "unprecedented". 
</p><p>The scale of British jihadists <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10758623/Syria-is-now-the-biggest-threat-to-Britains-security.html">who have flocked to Syria</a> to fight alongside Isil has been the driving force behind the rise. It is feared more than 700 Britons have travelled to Syria, half of who have already returned to the UK, posing a threat here.
