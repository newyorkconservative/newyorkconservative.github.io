<p>The Ford Foundation is financing a network of insurgents that intimidate elected officials and citizens to bring about dangerous political change. The FBI defines using intimidation and violence to achieve political ends as <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/terrorism">domestic terrorism</a>.</p>

<p>Like other private foundations, Ford is governed only by basic IRS filing requirements and has virtually no public oversight. With woke leaders like Cisco’s CEO Chuck Robbins, Ford Motor Company’s Henry Ford III, and abortion giant Planned Parenthood’s former president Cecile Richards sitting on <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/about/people/board-of-trustees/">Ford’s board</a>, be assured it will not cut off the funding to these Democrat street squads.</p>
