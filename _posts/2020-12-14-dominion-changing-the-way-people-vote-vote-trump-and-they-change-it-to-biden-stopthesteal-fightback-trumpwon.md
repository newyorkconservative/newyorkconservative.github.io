<p>Michigan Voting Fraud accusations are supported by the Dominion Voting Systems Forensic Examination report from ASOG!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The deep dive forensic exam of Dominion Voting System machines and software conducted on-site December 6, 2020 in Antrim County, Michigan and still continuing today, has resulted in damning accusations of hard evidence and several smoking guns of intentional vote manipulation- and fraud!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 22-page preliminary report compiled by the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/488088354/Ex-1-Bios?secret_password=RV83DmUAaa6AUFfM09Qu">7-member team</a> <sup>[1]</sup> from Allied Security Operations Group can be read here in it’s entirety.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Top Bombshell takeaways from the report—<br>1.) ASOG’s bottom line is found on page 1: We conclude that the Dominion Voting System is intentionally and purposefully designed with inherent errors to create systemic fraud and influence election results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2.) Item 6: The allowable election error rate established by the Federal Election Commission guidelines is of 1 in 250,000 ballots (.0008%). We observed an error rate of 68.05%. This demonstrated a significant and fatal error in security and election integrity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3.) Item 15: Significantly, the computer system shows vote adjudication logs for prior years, but all adjudication log entries for the 2020 election cycle are missing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>4.) Item 16: Likewise, all server security logs prior to 11:03pm on November 4, 2020 are missing. Other server logs before November 4, 2020 are present, therefore, there is no reasonable explanation for the security logs to be missing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>5.) Item 19: This is clear evidence of software generated movement of votes. The claims made on the Office of the Secretary of State website are false.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>6.) Item 22: we conclude that the errors are so significant that they call into question the integrity and legitimacy of the results in the Antrim County 2020 election to the point that the results are not certifiable. Because the same machines are used in 48 other counties in Michigan, this casts doubt on the integrity of the entire election in the state of Michigan.</p>
