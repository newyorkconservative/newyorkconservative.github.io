Muslims believe that the Gospels are a corruption of the message that Jesus was given. From the Islamic point of view, the Jesus portrayed in the Christian Gospels is a false Jesus. The true Jesus—the one who denies that he is the son of God—is to be found in the Koran. Keep that in mind the next time that a Muslim apologist (or a Catholic apologist for Islam) tells you that Muslims love and honor Jesus. It’s not the same Jesus.
