“Evil is a mystery that reaches summits of horror beyond what is human,” Rouen’s Archbishop Dominique Lebrun said, according to Breitbart. “Is that not what you meant, Jacques, by your last words? Falling to the ground after the first stab, you try to push away your attacker with your feet saying, ‘Go away Satan!’”

According to Archbishop Lebrun, the injured priest then screamed a second time, “Be gone, Satan!” before succumbing to his death.
The archdiocese had a stole placed on a large cross during the ceremony, as a symbol showing the priest’s death to be similar to Jesus’.

Among the thousands of attendees were members of the Muslim community.

The Archbishop took a moment during his homily to directly address the group, warning them against temptation the jihad may present. “You who are tormented by diabolical violence, you who are drawn to kill by a demonic, murderous madness, pray to God to free you from the devil’s grip,” he said. “We pray for you, we pray to Jesus who healed all those who were under the power of evil.”
