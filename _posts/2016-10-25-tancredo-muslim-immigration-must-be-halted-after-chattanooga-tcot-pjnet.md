We ought to halt all legal immigration and refugee resettlement from Muslim-majority countries and declare an indefinite moratorium â€” until two changes occur. First, we must devise a better way to identify and deny admission not only to terrorists but also to persons who sympathize with radical Islamism. It will surprise the average American to learn we are not capable of doing that today.

Second, we must change naturalization laws to create a 7-year probationary period during which any new citizen of any religion or national origin can be stripped of citizenship and deported easily if the person demonstrates any support for radical Islamists.

<em>Why do this? Because we are at war with radical Islam. It is time we started acting like we understand that reality.</em>
