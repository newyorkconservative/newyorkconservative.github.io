At least 12 people died and around 50 were injured after a truck smashed its way through a Christmas market in Berlin in a suspected terror attack.

Islamic State claimed the attack, describing the driver as “a soldier of” of their jihadi terror group, and police are currently searching for a 24-year-old Tunisian immigrant suspect named as Anis A. thought to have Islamist links.
