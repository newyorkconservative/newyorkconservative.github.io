NEW YORK, NY – Following President Trump’s proclamation today that his administration will officially recognize Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel and begin the process of moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, Michael S. Glassner, Executive Director of Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., issued the following statement:

“Once again, President Trump has demonstrated the kind of leadership that Washington does not recognize or understand. The President’s proclamation that the United States will officially recognize Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel and move our embassy there is yet another example that with Donald J. Trump, a promise made is a promise kept. More importantly, President Trump did not reach this decision hastily or as a conclusion unto itself, but as a means towards a more peaceful Middle East. By calling on political and religious leaders to ‘rededicate ourselves to a path of mutual understanding and respect,’ the President makes it clear that not only does Israel have a trusted friend in the United States once again, but that his ultimate goal is to promote peace throughout the Middle East so that all people in the region may enjoy freedom and prosperity.”
