<a href="http://shoebat.com/2017/01/04/landmark-federal-court-ruling-opens-the-way-for-explosion-of-constructing-mega-mosques-across-america/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+shoebat+%28Walid+Shoebat%29" target="_blank">Andrew Bieszad</a>, an Islam scholar, has a different take. In an article titled “landmark federal court ruling opens the way for explosion of constructing mega-mosques across America,” he states that “the issue here is not about parking spaces or religious freedom—it is about the presence of Islam.” He goes on to observe:

Islam does not come into a society to co-exist with others. Islam comes with the intention of invading, dominating, and eventually either assimilating or enslaving the area.

Harsh words. But if they are true, then doesn’t it make sense to discriminate against Islam? Adeel Mangi says that applicants shouldn’t be treated “differently based on their religion,” but if a religion aims to subjugate other religions (and cultures) then wouldn’t it be foolish not to treat it differently?
