ISIS has basically given an ultimatum to all the Christians left: You can either flee or convert to Islam, or we will kill you."

"Whether it was to save the Muslims in Bosnia or the Albanians, Kosovars, and Muslims in Serbia, it is now time for a humanitarian operation to save the remaining Christians in Iraq," he said. "It is time for the American people and our representatives to do something for our co-religionists remaining in the Middle East."
