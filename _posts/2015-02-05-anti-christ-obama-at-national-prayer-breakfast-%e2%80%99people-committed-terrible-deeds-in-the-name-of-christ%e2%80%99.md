	</p><p><span style="color:#111111; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Obama said that even though religion is a source for good around the world, there will always be people willing to "hijack religion for their own murderous ends."
</span></p><p><span style="color:#111111; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">"Unless we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place, remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ," <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?324188-1/2015-national-prayer-breakfast"><span style="color:#0088bb">Obama said.</span></a> "In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ."
</span></p><p><span style="color:#111111; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">Obama also denounced Islamic State terrorists for professing to stand up for Islam when they were actually "betraying it."
</span></p><p><span style="color:#111111; font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">"We see ISIL, a brutal vicious death cult that in the name of religion carries out unspeakable acts of barbarism," he said criticizing them for "claiming the mantle of religious authority for such actions."
