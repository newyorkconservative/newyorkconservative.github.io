<p>“Max Rose&nbsp;said his ‘<a href="https://www.maxroseforcongress.com/index.php/campaign-issue/supporting-first-responders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top priority</a>‘ is the ‘<a href="https://www.maxroseforcongress.com/index.php/campaign-issue/supporting-first-responders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">safety and security of our community</a>,’ but then doubled down on his support of the dangerous bail reform law that continues to put dangerous criminals back on the streets,” Reinert said.</p>

<p>He added, “Voters are fed up with Congressman Rose saying one thing on the campaign trail and doing the exact opposite in Washington, and it’s why they’re itching to send him home this fall.”</p>
