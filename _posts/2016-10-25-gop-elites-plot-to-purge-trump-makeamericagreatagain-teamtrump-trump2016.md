Trump says our negotiators have been getting their clocks cleaned by the Japanese, Chinese and Mexicans.

Is he wrong? Or are free trade and open borders now articles of faith, defined dogma, denial of which gets you excommunicated from the party of Gerson and Will?

Trump should tell the GOP, in the neocons’ favorite phrase, “All options are on the table.” And that includes the Samson Option.

Trump should tell the GOP that if it disrespects him and his followers, then he is prepared to do as did the biblical hero Samson, when, blinded and mocked by the Philistines, he pushed the pillars apart and brought the temple down upon the heads of them all.

The Republican establishment will understand that.
