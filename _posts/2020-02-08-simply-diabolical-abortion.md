<p>This could be one of the more disturbing things that I have seen on twitter - retweeted by @MaryMargOlohan - The point Mary was making in her below tweet, it speaks for itself, is that Pro-Life groups like Live Action are not even able to advertise on twitter and even get banned on TikTok for talking about abortion. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have followed Live Action for a long time and they are extremely respectful in the manner in which they post, yet they are constantly silenced, censored and discriminated against. </p>

<p>In the video a young woman is talking about finding out the gender of her baby - but the video is a parody - she is actually going to get an abortion and in the end of the video she says it's a....and instead of saying boy or girl, holds up a sign laughing that says "aborted." So the baby was "aborted."</p>

<p>Is it a far stretch to say that this kind of cruelty mirrors the cruelty and evil that was found in the extermination camps in Nazi Germany? </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What kind of a human being gleefully celebrates the murder of their own child? Let alone video the experience and make a joke out of it on social media?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And what kind of an internet platform would allow such a diabolical episode?</p>

<p>These are the things that pass for the "conversation" on today's social media.<br></p>
