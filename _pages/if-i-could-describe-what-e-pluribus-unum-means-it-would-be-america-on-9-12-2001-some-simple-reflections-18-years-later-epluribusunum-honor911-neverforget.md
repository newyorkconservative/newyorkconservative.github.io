<p>This year I attended the 9/11 ceremony at the Postcards memorial on Staten Island. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>18 years later. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is still hard to believe and a very surreal day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For most American's 9/11 stirs up all sorts of emotions. For those that were directly impacted, those that lost family, the pain and sense of loss is the greatest. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Their lives were never the same after that day and can never be the same again. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For those of us that were close to the attacks but are alive today it is in many ways just emotional overload and there is no good way to even really describe it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The gratitude for life, the ability to make something meaningful of it and the realization of just how precious it is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lest we forget the military families who have been so greatly impacted by that day. We have to remember and honor those heroes that defended America after 9/11 and those who made the ultimate sacrifice in the wars that followed 9/11.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today in New York City we are now losing many people to 9/11 related illness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year at the Postcards memorial it was the first time where the names of the first responders who have died from 9/11 illness were read. A new section of the memorial has been built etched with the many names of those first responders who have died from 9/11 related illness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you lived in New York City during September 11th 2001 you knew someone who was lost that day but chances are you knew multiple people. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were people killed that day that I grew up with, that I knew from childhood, from high school, my Parish and workplace. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This experience was not unique - many New Yorker's can identify with it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>18 years later there are some other things I was thinking about - in 2019 young men and women who are in college today as freshmen were not even born when 9/11 happened and many young adults were too young to remember that day clearly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To a large extent, in 2019, for many millions of American's 9/11 is now just a chapter in American history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It made me realize how important it is to attend these memorials, to talk about 9/11 and to keep the memory of those people who were so senselessly killed that day alive in our thoughts - we can "Never Forget."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was also thinking about 9/12/2001 and our National motto - "E Pluribus Unum" which means "out of many one" and I realized that if there was any day where I could say a feeling embodied that motto it was 9/12/2001.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The attacks unified America - "Out of Many" we were definitely one and you felt it on 9/12.</p>
